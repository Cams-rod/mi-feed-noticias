Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, also released documents last week that her office said shed new light on this “<a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4093-pr-19-25">Russia hoax</a>.” Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly ordered a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/04/doj-obama-2016-election-russia-bondi/">grand-jury investigation</a> into claims that Obama-administration officials broke laws while investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>The DNI’s office doesn’t explain exactly what the “Russia hoax” is, and for good reason. First, although the phrase has achieved talismanic status in Trump world, it has no set definition, because Trump keeps changing the meaning. Second, and more important, it’s not a hoax.</p><p>Here’s what is not in dispute: The United States intelligence community concluded that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election and, according to a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election">GOP-led Senate investigation</a>, wanted to help Trump. As Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/dl?inline=">report</a> summarizing his findings, “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.” Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his campaign chair Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Russians who they believed would hand over “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. (Steve Bannon—Steve Bannon!—called the meeting “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/steve-bannon-is-trumps-frankenstein-monster/549566/?utm_source=feed">treasonous</a>.”) A Trump <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/george-papadopoulos/544346/?utm_source=feed">2016-campaign aide</a> boasted to an Australian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html">diplomat</a> that Russia was trying to help the Trump campaign, and then lied about his Russian contacts to FBI agents. Trump publicly <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-putin-no-relationship-226282">called</a> on Russia to hack Clinton’s emails in July 2016—jokingly, he has since <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/politics/trump-emails-joke">said</a>—and Russian agents attempted to do so that very day, according to the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/russia-hacking-trump-mueller/565157/?utm_source=feed">Justice Department</a>. Hackers who the U.S. government believes were connected to Russia obtained emails from a number of Democratic Party officials and leaked them publicly, and Trump pal <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/we-still-dont-know-what-happened-between-trump-and-russia/602116/?utm_source=feed">Roger Stone</a> was apparently forewarned about some. Major tech companies, including <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2017/10/hard-questions-russian-ads-delivered-to-congress/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2017/Update-Russian-Interference-in-2016--Election-Bots-and-Misinformation">Twitter</a> (now X), also confirmed that they had detected dubious Russian activity.</p><p>In spite of all of this evidence, or perhaps because of it, Trump has loudly insisted that it’s all a hoax. He’s used the phrase off and on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/11-times-president-trump-called-russia-probe-hoax/story?id=50809892">since spring 2017</a>, though he’s changed what he means. For a time, he made the claim—without evidence then, and without any since—that the federal government under Barack Obama had <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/trump-keeps-changing-his-story-about-wiretapping/522762/?utm_source=feed">wiretapped</a> or improperly surveilled him. At other times, he has claimed that the whole thing is a “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/trumps-assault-on-rule-of-law/557600/?utm_source=feed">witch hunt</a>.” Often, he generically used the term <i>hoax</i> to refer to any allegations about Russian involvement in the 2016 election. He even sued the Pulitzer Prize Board over a statement honoring reporting on connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. (The <a href="https://www.wusf.org/courts-law/2025-07-02/pulitzer-board-goes-florida-supreme-court-halt-trumps-defamation-lawsuit">case</a> is ongoing.)</p><p>His attempts to instill doubt have been assisted by the fact that some of the wilder rumors and reports concerning his campaign didn’t turn out to be true. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ex-trump-campaign-aide-carter-page-notches-victory-after-inspector-general-hammers-fbi-for-surveillance-missteps/2019/12/14/6daac5f2-1dda-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html">Carter Page</a>, a Trump campaign adviser, was a bit of an eccentric character but not a traitor, as some suggested, much less the key to unraveling any grand conspiracy. Trump was probably not communicating with a Russian bank via a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/trump-organizations-mystery-server/572485/?utm_source=feed">mysterious server</a>. He was almost certainly not a longtime <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-collusion.html">Russian-intelligence asset</a>. The so-called Steele dossier was full of falsehoods. I argued at the time that <i>BuzzFeed</i>’s decision to publish it was a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/why-did-buzzfeed-publish-the-trump-dossier/512771/?utm_source=feed">grievous error</a>, and it warped <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/buzzfeed-publishing-steele-dossier-distorted-debate/586096/?utm_source=feed">conversation</a> about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.</p><p>Mueller’s highly anticipated investigation also landed with a big thud. First, expectations for his report had been inflated by an overeager circle of Trump critics who had expected shocking new revelations; the revelations were indeed shocking, but by the time Mueller published them, most had already filtered out in press accounts. Second, debate over Trump’s ties to Russia had focused on “collusion,” which is not a specific crime. This produced a semantic sideshow argument in which Trump insisted that he couldn’t have colluded, because he wasn’t charged with it. Third, Attorney General <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/barr-misled-the-publicand-it-worked/588463/?utm_source=feed">Bill Barr</a> misrepresented Mueller’s findings. Fourth, Mueller did not recommend charges against Trump, thanks to Justice Department guidance against charging a sitting president, which meant that although the special counsel produced an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/mueller-wont-say-it-but-trump-clearly-obstructed-justice/594634/?utm_source=feed">unmistakable implicit accusation</a>, Trump claimed vindication.</p><p>Trump’s use of pardons may have induced some of his confederates—including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/we-still-dont-know-what-happened-between-trump-and-russia/602116/?utm_source=feed">Stone</a> and Manafort—to not cooperate with prosecutors, or to only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/manafort-mueller.html">partly cooperate</a>, thus depriving the public of a chance at receiving a full accounting. This was a kind of legalized obstruction of justice.</p><p>Plenty of authorities have pointed out that Trump’s claim of a hoax is nonsense. In 2017, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/dec/12/2017-lie-year-russian-election-interference-made-s/">PolitiFact</a><i> </i>named that its lie of the year. In 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-russia-hoax-turns-out-to-be-real/2018/02/16/be3d174a-1346-11e8-9065-e55346f6de81_story.html"><i>The Washington Post</i></a><i> </i>reported: “Trump’s Russia ‘Hoax’ Turns Out to Be Real.” In 2019, a report by the Justice Department’s inspector general concluded that, as my colleague <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/there-was-never-deep-state-conspiracy-get-trump/603361/?utm_source=feed">Adam Serwer</a> put it, “the ‘Russia hoax’ defense is itself a hoax, and a highly successful one, aimed at reassuring Trump supporters who might otherwise be troubled by the president’s behavior.” Still, the idea that the whole thing was a chimera has taken hold even within some <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/05/17/durham-report-vindicates-trump-fbi-russia-investigation/70222344007/">precincts</a> of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/2/15/23588121/trump-russia-cjr-jeff-gerth-russiagate">mainstream press</a>, where the whole thing is treated as a weird passing obsession. The journalist Ben Smith, who made the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/ben-smith-trump-dossier-buzzfeed/673794/?gift=pp7wR3qo8KCFa3FiAYHCyBjnGbMbsEO4bMXyz0dujIw&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">decision</a> to publish the Steele dossier, now contends, vaguely and in passive voice, that “<a href="https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/08/03/2025/semafor-media-tides-turn">Trump was in retrospect treated unfairly</a>.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump world continues to cook up new iterations of the hoax claim. The most recent ones are driven by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who has a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/01/ratcliffe-dni-cia-trump/681197/?utm_source=feed">history of weaponizing intelligence, </a>to use a term he’s a fan of, and Gabbard, who has for years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html">repeated Kremlin talking points</a>. Last month, Ratcliffe <a href="https://x.com/CIADirector/status/1940452440937263396">alleged</a> that in 2016, three of the nation’s top intelligence officials “manipulated intelligence and silenced career professionals—all to get Trump,” but as my colleague <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/07/cia-note-russia-hoax/683464/?utm_source=feed">Shane Harris</a> reported, he didn’t have evidence to back that up. Gabbard has released a <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4086-pr-15-25">dribble</a> of <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4090-pr-18-25">documents</a> intended to <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4093-pr-19-25">bolster</a> it, but still nothing that matches the claims.</p><p>In recent days, MAGA allies have pushed a new and shocking <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/us-news/hillary-clinton-approved-plan-hatched-by-campaign-aides-to-smear-trump-with-russia-collusion-declassified-docs/">allegation</a>: that emails show Clinton actually approved a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376524315112">plan</a> to smear Trump by claiming he was colluding with Russia. The problem is that, once again, investigations have debunked it. A special counsel appointed by Barr during Trump’s first term, with the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/john-durham-probe-gave-trump-what-he-wanted/671432/?utm_source=feed">goal of ferreting out</a> political skulduggery in the Russia investigation, found that messages about Clinton being treated as a smoking gun were, in fact, likely concocted by the Russians. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/us/politics/trump-clinton-emails-russia-investigation.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a><i> </i>reported, “The special counsel, John H. Durham, went to great lengths to try to prove that several of the emails were real, only to ultimately conclude otherwise.”</p><p>Durham’s finding of a Russian forgery is ironic: Someone has finally turned up a real Russia hoax. Rather than working to fight it, however, Trump’s aides are once more colluding with Russia to mislead the American people and further Trump’s political fortunes.</p><p><b>Related:</b></p><ul>

<p>What’s Really Behind the Cult of Labubu</p><p><i>By Valerie Trapp</i></p><blockquote>
<p>A furry fiend with rabbit ears and a maniacal grin has recently been spotted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kartierb/video/7521203053693898039?lang=en&amp;q=lizzo%20labubu&amp;t=1752171485317">twerking</a> next to the singer Lizzo, <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/hfm/fashion-trends/833522/david-beckhams-stylish-bag-charm-is-bang-on-trend-for-ss25/">baring its teeth</a> on the former soccer star David Beckham’s Instagram, and flopping against a woman’s Chanel bag while wearing its own <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@susieesong/video/7473981376660851974?lang=en&amp;q=purse%20labubu&amp;t=1752171654266">Tic Tac–size Chanel bag</a>. The creature in question is Labubu—a soft-bellied plushie that the Chinese company Pop Mart began distributing in 2019, and that has, in the past year, gained hordes of admirers. In 2024, Pop Mart reported a more than 700 percent increase in the stuffie’s sales. People have been doling out anywhere from about $30 to <a href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/hk/lifestyle/art-plus-design/most-expensive-labubu-dolls-auction/">$150,000</a> a toy. At <a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/the-hottest-party-in-new-york-right-now-labubu-raves">Brooklyn raves</a>, adults hop around under neon lights with Labubus clipped to their belt loops. The devotion, at times, has turned almost ferocious.</p>

                        <div class="content"><p>Last week, the Department of Homeland Security debuted a recruitment strategy to expand the ranks of ICE: sign-on bonuses. Thanks to a rush of cash from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the department announced that it’s offering up to $50,000 to newly hired federal law-enforcement agents. The offer caught the eye of one group that seemed to be particularly pleased by the government’s exciting career opportunity. On Telegram, an account linked to the Toledo, Ohio, chapter of the Proud Boys declared: “Toledo Boys living high on the hog right now!!”</p><p></p><p>Whether members of the extremist group have pursued job openings at ICE, much less been hired and handed a big check, is unclear. I asked the Toledo chapter whether its members are applying to work for the government, but I didn’t hear back. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in an email that “any individual who desires to join ICE will undergo intense background investigations and security clearances—no exception.” But the Toledo Proud Boys’ enthusiasm for the work, if nothing else, is telling. The Trump administration is enacting a mass-deportation campaign centered around <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/06/trump-mass-deportations-spectacle/683187/?utm_source=feed">aggression and cruelty</a>. The Proud Boys are staunchly against undocumented immigrants, and have repeatedly intimidated and physically antagonized their enemies (during the first Trump administration, they often got into fights with left-wing protesters). The group’s ideals are being pursued—but by ICE and the government itself.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/06/trump-mass-deportations-spectacle/683187/?utm_source=feed">Trump’s deportations aren’t what they seem</a>]</i></p><p>There was every reason to believe that the Proud Boys would run wild in Donald Trump’s second term. On his first day back in the White House, Trump pardoned everyone who was convicted for crimes related to the insurrection on January 6, 2021—including roughly 100 known members of the Proud Boys and other extremist organizations. They had received some of the harshest sentences tied to the Capitol riot: All 14 people who were still in prison when Trump returned to office were affiliated with either the Proud Boys or the Oath Keepers. At the time, a terrorism expert at the Council on Foreign Relations warned that the pardons “could be catastrophic for public safety,” sending a message to extremist groups that violence in the name of MAGA “is legal and legitimate.” Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys who himself was pardoned, announced that there would be hell to pay: “I’m happy that the president is focusing not on retribution, and focusing on success,” he said on Infowars, “but I will tell you that I’m not gonna play by those rules.”</p><p></p><p>Six months later, though, the Proud Boys have been surprisingly quiet. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data (ACLED), a nonprofit that tracks political violence, the Proud Boys have been less active in 2025 than over the preceding several years. Since his release, Tarrio’s most prominent action has been helping launch “ICERAID,” a website that pays people in crypto in exchange for reporting undocumented immigrants. Tarrio, who did not respond to an interview request through a lawyer, also co-hosts frequent livestreams on X. In one episode of a livestream last month, Tarrio nursed a cigarette while a man who identified himself only as “Patriot Rob” waxed nostalgic about how inescapable the Proud Boys once were. In 2020, members of the militant group showed up at anti-lockdown rallies across the country, clashed with racial-justice protesters, and earned a shout-out from Trump himself during a presidential debate. (The Proud Boys so frequently traveled to Washington, D.C., for various kinds of protests in 2020 that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/14/harrys-bar-proud-boys-washington-dc-445015"><em>Politico</em></a> wrote about their favorite bar.) Now, Patriot Rob said on the livestream, “there’s very few of us left.”</p><p>It’s unclear how many Proud Boy chapters there are today, but some seem to be defunct: Those in Philadelphia and Michigan have let their websites turn into dead links and stopped posting on Telegram, the social platform of choice for most Proud Boys. I reached out to 10 Proud Boy chapters and requested interviews. None was willing to speak with me. After I told a Miami chapter that I had spoken with experts on the current state of the Proud Boys, someone who identified himself only as “Alex” responded: “Experts’ lol Experts at what? Sucking cock Y’all can go fuck yourselves!” The East Tennessee Chapter, perhaps mistaking my name for a woman’s, replied by saying, “We’re going to request some nudes in order to confirm your identity 👌.”</p><p>The Proud Boys have not disappeared. They <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/proud-boys-and-militias-come-to-teslas-defense/">have been spotted</a> at a “Tesla Takedown” event in Salem, Oregon; <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/01/25/proud-boys-anti-aobrtion-march/">marched</a> with anti-abortion activists in San Francisco; and <a href="https://www.gulfcoastnewsnow.com/article/ptrotest-alligator-alcatraz-tribe-proud-boys-tarrio/65269134">confronted</a><a href="https://www.gulfcoastnewsnow.com/article/ptrotest-alligator-alcatraz-tribe-proud-boys-tarrio/65269134"> protesters</a> outside of the “Alligator Alcatraz” ICE facility. Other right-wing groups have been more active. After the Texas floods last month, a leader of the Patriot Front claimed that the extremist group was involved in recovery efforts to help “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/texas-floods-patriot-front">European peoples</a>.” Patriot Front, which has also held several marches across the country since the start of Trump’s second term, remains a small organization. Estimates put its membership at 200 to 300 people, compared with the thousands that researchers believe are, or at least were, in the Proud Boys. On the whole, militia groups are “keeping it low-key,” Amy Cooter, the deputy director and a co-founder of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, told me. Since the start of the year, ACLED has recorded 108 extremist protests nationwide—not even half as many as at this point in 2022. This is not entirely unexpected. As my colleague Adrienne LaFrance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/09/trump-butler-assassination-attempt-pa-rally/679153/?utm_source=feed">has reported</a>, in the 1990s, a surge of militia activity and white nationalism appeared to die down after the Oklahoma City bombing—but those movements never disappeared; they simply moved underground.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/us-extremism-portland-george-floyd-protests-january-6/673088/?utm_source=feed">Read: The new anarchy</a>]</i></p><p>Today, part of the reason for the apparent decline is that even after Trump’s pardons, far-right groups are still dealing with the hangover of January 6. Militia groups have always been relatively splintered, but the insurrection exacerbated the fissures. Some Oath Keeper groups are divided on whether their leader, Stewart Rhodes, went too far on January 6, when he rallied Oath Keepers to breach the Capitol, Cooter said. Some members <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/these-three-north-bay-men-decided-to-leave-the-oath-keepers-heres-why/#:~:text=A%20Press%20Democrat%20investigation%20revealed,I%20know%20history%20too%20well.%E2%80%9D">have been</a> vocal about leaving the organization, citing Rhodes’s leadership. In 2022, the Southern Poverty Law Center recorded five active Oath Keepers chapters, <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/report-even-as-militias-disbanded-anti-government-groups-surged-in-us-/7126248.html">down from 70 in 2020</a>. (The number of current chapters is not clear.)</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Proud Boys fractured in 2021, after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-proudboys-leader-idUSKBN29W1PE/">Reuters</a> uncovered court records indicating that Tarrio had served as an informant to local and federal law enforcement before the group was founded. (“I don’t recall any of this,” Tarrio told Reuters at the time.) Many Proud Boys chapters disavowed him, including part of his own in Miami. The city now has two separate chapters, an anti-Tarrio and a pro-Tarrio one. In January, I emailed the Toledo Proud Boys chapter to ask about Tarrio. I received an unattributed reply expressing disappointment that Tarrio had “turned his back and squealed on brothers.” I reached back out this week, and received a similar response: “Tarrio is a rat, punk, and low life!” The respondent also said this: “You breland, are exactly what President Trump said. .fake news! I’m sure you preferred the last potatoe!” (I asked if by “the last potato,” the account meant Joe Biden. “Ahhh yes. .SMH,” the respondent said. “You know. .the illegitimate one! The stolen election one! The one who wandered around aimlessly!”)</p><p></p><p>The bigger reason that these far-right groups remain underground is that the Trump administration’s aggressive agenda has left them with little to do. One of the motivating issues for the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other extremist groups is strong opposition to undocumented immigrants. After the presidential election, a leader of the Texas chapter of the Three Percenters, a militia group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/far-right-militias-border-trump.html">reportedly wrote</a> to Trump to offer manpower in enacting mass deportations. But ICE and other federal agencies are engaging in forceful action against immigrants backed by the state in a way that surpasses what the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys could ever do. ICE agents, not far-right militias, are the ones who have smashed through car windows, thrown people into unmarked vans, and detained them indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>Even apart from immigration, “groups are taking a hands-off approach right now because their interests are often aligned with the government,” Freddy Cruz, a researcher at the Western States Center, a nonprofit that tracks extremism, told me. The Proud Boys was started in 2016 in part to double down on traditional gender norms. Gavin McInnes, the group’s founder, has described the Proud Boys as a “pro-Western fraternity” for men who “long for the days when girls were girls and men were men.” The Proud Boys’ extreme pro-male views are less distinct than they once were, as MAGA has embraced Andrew Tate and other openly misogynistic figures of the so-called manosphere. As a result, the Proud Boys have one less point to rally around.</p><p></p><p>Still, the Proud Boys and other right-wing militias might not stay underground forever. Under the right conditions, they could surge once again. “These groups are really responsive to news cycles,” Cooter said. They have specific flash points—immigration, the Second Amendment, and supposed “election integrity”—that can mobilize them in certain contexts, she explained. The Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other established far-right groups still have infrastructure, a durable brand name, and the precedent that Trump might pardon them if things go awry. In May, Tarrio was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/us/politics/trump-tarrio-proud-boys-pardon.html">reportedly</a> invited to Mar-a-Lago, where he briefly spoke with Trump. Newer groups continue to organize. Patriot Front, for example, has teamed up with “Active Clubs,” a loose network of white supremacists and neo-Nazis who run their own mixed-martial-arts fight clubs. Together, all of this could help give extremist groups a head start that they didn’t have in the first Trump administration, when the Proud Boys and many other militia groups began to find their footing. The pieces are there, even if the moment isn’t yet.</p></div>

This dynamic might seem paradoxical, but the two phenomena exist in a natural symbiosis. Anti-Semites often insist they are being targeted merely for criticizing Israel; their defense becomes more effective when many people are, in fact, being called anti-Semitic merely for criticizing Israel.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/anti-semitic-attacks-only-make-zionism-more-appealing/683055/?utm_source=feed">Yair Rosenberg: America’s anti-Jewish assassins are making the case for Zionism</a>]</i></p><p>The hallmark of this style of politics is that, although it does not explicitly state that all criticism of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic, it acts as though that were true. Consider another recent episode. Late last month, <i>The New York Times</i> ran a photo of a child in Gaza, who the accompanying article said was “born a healthy child” but had recently been “diagnosed with severe malnutrition.” Later, it added an editor’s note clarifying that he “also had pre-existing health problems,” which should have been noted in the photo caption.</p><p>Newspapers make errors from time to time, especially while covering wars, when verifying facts is more dangerous and difficult. Yet some conservatives immediately determined not only that the error reflected an institutional bias against Israel—hardly an indisputable premise, given the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1236130609/new-york-times-hamas-attacks-israel-palestine">anger</a> that the <i>Times</i> has generated on the left for its reporting on such topics as sexual violence by Hamas—but that this bias in turn reflected animus against Jews. “The media were so eager to produce a story about Jews behaving amorally that they dropped all skepticism in the face of a sensationalistic claim from a terrorist group with a known history of lying,” <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-mainstream-misinformation-merchants/">wrote</a> the <i>National Review</i> editor Philip Klein.</p><p>Noah Pollak, a Trump appointee at the Department of Education, did not even grant that the error was inadvertent, <a href="https://x.com/NoahPollak/status/1950315139925774825">charging</a> on X that the paper had <i>deliberately</i> published a falsehood: “This is a really strange way of saying ‘We ran a front page blood libel claiming Israel is starving a baby to death, but it’s not true and we actually knew it wasn’t true at the time, but it promoted hatred of Jews so we ran it anyway.’” Likewise, <a href="https://www.commentary.org/seth-mandel/why-the-truth-matters/">Seth Mandel</a>, writing in <i>Commentary</i>, treated the error as an act of anti-Semitic malice: “Pointing to a suffering child and saying ‘the Jews did this’ when in fact the Jews did no such thing is an intentional act.” As with the Sanders episode, none of these critics offered any explanation as to why the <i>Times—</i>a newspaper whose executive editor, along with many staffers, is Jewish—would be institutionally committed to whipping up anti-Semitic animus.</p><p>The proliferation of the term <i>blood libel</i> as a rhetorical tic is especially revealing. The blood libel is a medieval conspiracy theory that posits that Jews murder Christian children in order to use their blood in religious ceremonies. It was used for centuries to incite murder against Jews. My wife’s grandmother once told me that <i>her</i> mother had a vivid memory of being a child in 19th-century Russia, hiding under a bed and watching a Cossack plant a dead child in her family’s home to blame on the Jews.</p><p>To claim that Israel murders Arab children for religious ends would be a blood libel. And because anti-Semitic ideas mutate over time, some forms of obsessive hatred of Israel assign the Jewish state an almost demonic place in the imagination. Anti-Semitism can express itself as an inability to process Israel’s actions, whether good or bad, in the terms one would use for other nations.</p><p>But to the extent that the outrage over civilian deaths in Gaza is not categorically different from that surrounding, say, the American counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, Israel’s critics are treating it as a normal state. Some elements of the contemporary pro-Israel right have refused to accept that. They have, instead, repurposed the phrase <i>blood libel</i> to cast almost any complaint about the Israeli war effort as anti-Semitic. Because arguments about the scope of war inherently revolve around the propriety of violence, this tactic has limitless application.</p><p>This rhetorical move is striking in its resemblance to the style of the illiberal left. If you identify your own political position with a vulnerable group, you can accuse anybody who disagrees of opposing the group, thus circumventing the need to defend your position on the merits. The most common fallacy associated with this form of backward reasoning is to assume that any argument a bigot might use is bigoted. Because racists oppose affirmative action, its defenders sometimes assume all opponents of affirmative action are racist; likewise, because anti-Semites hate Israel, some of its defenders treat opposition to Israel as presumptively anti-Semitic.</p><p>In some cases, the homage is explicit. Some campus activists have demanded that pro-Israel Jews receive the kind of protective <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/?utm_source=feed">treatment</a> that university administrators have previously extended to students from, or speaking on behalf of, other marginalized groups. (Others have merely asked that schools fairly apply content-neutral rules to activists who seize common spaces or shout down pro-Israel speakers.) This would be a logical demand if you believe that illiberal discourse norms have benefited minority students and fostered tolerance. But if you believe that they’ve generated resentment without helping their supposed beneficiaries, as members of the pro-Israel right generally do, then it is a strange racket to try to get in on.</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">The Trump administration</span> has turned these illiberal concepts into official government policy. Its higher-education agenda revolves around the use of pretextual charges of anti-Semitism to withhold funding and subject universities to political interference. It has detained immigrant students for <a href="https://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/judge-tufts-students-op-ed-criticizing-israel-insufficient-to-justify-detention/">criticizing</a> Israel and worked with right-wing activists to target protesters and issue draconian demands for “reform.”</p><p>How could a movement prone to hair-trigger charges of anti-Semitism identify itself so closely with this administration? President Donald Trump has welcomed an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/mahmoud-khalil-arrest-ice/682002/?utm_source=feed">anti-Semitic and even Nazi-curious</a> faction into his coalition, normalizing rhetoric that not long ago would have been disqualifying in a Republican administration. (Kingsley Wilson, a Defense Department <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5319995/kingsley-wilson-antisemitic-comments-defense-department-pentagon">spokesperson</a>, has dabbled in anti-Semitic memes, including attacking the memory of Leo Frank, perhaps the most famous victim of anti-Semitic violence in U.S. history.) Trump himself has routinely discussed Jews in crude terms, as money-obsessed and primarily loyal to Israel.</p><p>In fact, the alliance has a certain logic to it. The pro-Israel right is not so much expanding the definition of what constitutes anti-Semitism as shifting it, so that it covers far <i>more</i> criticism of Israel and far <i>less</i> behavior that would traditionally have fit the bill. After Trump criticized unethical bankers as “shylocks”—drawing a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80p3v0xx53o">wrist slap</a> from the Anti-Defamation League, which has otherwise <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-statement-new-executive-order-combat-antisemitism">supported</a> his campus crackdown—the <i>Commentary</i> editor John Podhoretz <a href="https://x.com/jpodhoretz/status/1941185424174821558">wrote</a> on X, “Trump bombed Iran. He can say Shylock 100 times a day forever as far as I’m concerned.”</p><p>Here Podhoretz is following in the tradition of his father, Norman, who preceded John as editor of <i>Commentary</i>, once an esteemed journal of Jewish thought. Thirty years ago, after Pat Robertson published a conspiratorial book arguing that a tiny sect of “European bankers” had controlled world affairs for decades, Norman Podhoretz defended Robertson from charges of anti-Semitism in a lengthy <a href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/norman-podhoretz/in-the-matter-of-pat-robertson/">essay</a>. “In my view,” he wrote, “Robertson’s support for Israel trumps the anti-Semitic pedigree of his ideas about the secret history of the dream of a new world order.”</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/ngos-anti-israel-bias/682148/?utm_source=feed">Michael Powell: The double standard in the human-rights world</a>]</i></p><p>At the time, Robertson’s crankish views may have seemed marginal enough that his allies could pretend they were tolerable. The door that Podhoretz cracked open for one nutty televangelist has since swung wide open for hordes of obsessive anti-globalists, Nazi-meme appreciators, and other enemies of the Jews. Building a coalition united by its total indifference to Palestinian human rights requires teaming up with some people who may lack a certain moral refinement when it comes to the Jews. But you go to political war with the coalition you have, not the coalition you wish you had.</p><p>This alliance harms the Jews in two obvious ways. First, it provides cover for the legitimization of a strain of far-right anti-Semitism that had been frozen out of mainstream political influence since the demise of the “America First” movement at the start of World War II. Second, it weakens the fight against left-wing anti-Semitism by diluting the charge through overuse. Flooding the public square with counterfeit accusations devalues the currency. And allowing the cause to be turned into cover for a crackdown on the left that is at best loosely related to defending Jews inevitably subjects the idea of opposing anti-Semitism to cynicism. The pro-Israel right’s response to that critique is, of course, to label it as anti-Semitic. “Jews are being threatened with consequences for being seen as exercising undue influence over campus life,” writes the Manhattan Institute legal-policy fellow <a href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/tal-fortgang/trump-not-weaponizing-anti-semitism/">Tal Fortgang</a>.</p><p>American culture has passed through an era in which elements of the social-justice left sought to shut down opposition to their agenda by branding disagreement as bigotry. Members of the pro-Israel right, who gained power in part by riding the backlash against the excesses of left-wing illiberalism, have now decided to borrow its techniques. Can they truly not imagine that they will generate a backlash of their own?</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p>Asala Ferany sat cross-legged inside her tent in a camp near Deir al-Balah, trying to soothe her youngest child. Nada, barely more than a year old, clung to her mother’s neck with tiny, weak arms. The midday heat, nearly 90 degrees Fahrenheit, seeped through the plastic tarp above them. Sweat trickled down Asala’s face, and she had to leave the tent to get some air.</p><p>Nada hadn’t eaten since the night before, and the only thing left to feed her was a sachet of peanut paste—one of the last things Asala had managed to bring back from the aid-distribution point that morning.</p><p>“This is all I have,” she whispered, tearing a corner of the foil packet and squeezing a bit onto her finger. “I wish I could give her more, but there is nothing left.”</p><p>That morning, Asala and her husband, Mohammad Ferwana, had gone for the third or fourth time in a month to an aid center in Deir al-Balah, hoping to get their daughter additional treatment or food.</p><p>“The people in the camp look at Nada,” Asala told me. “They say, ‘She is too small. Take care of her. She’s too beloved.’ Some even say she might not survive two more months. I keep hugging her, kissing her. So if I lose her—I’ll know I loved her enough.”</p><p>Last month, Asala told me, she took Nada to a government-run health clinic that referred her to a distribution center run by aid groups. There, aid workers encircled Nada’s arm with paper tape, taking a measurement known as the mid-upper arm circumference that’s commonly used to assess malnutrition. As of last Wednesday, Nada’s upper arm measured 4.4 inches—meeting the threshold for severe, acute malnutrition. The aid workers gave Asala 14 red sachets of “ready-to-use therapeutic food” (RUTF), a nutrient-dense, high-calorie paste designed to manage wasting in children.</p><p>That wasn’t enough. “I asked if we could have more,” Asala told me. “But they just shook their heads. There are too many children. Too many mothers asking.”</p><p>When Asala got back to the tent, she quickly tucked the RUTF beneath her clothes. Her other children tended to eye the packets hungrily, and she needed to make sure that Nada, who needed them most, got her share. All of her children were thin, their ribs visible, but Nada was fading the fastest.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/usaid-doge-children-starvation/682484/?utm_source=feed">Read: ‘In three months, half of them will be dead’</a>]</i></p><p>By early afternoon, the camp had gone quiet with hunger. Then, at 1 p.m., a black tuk-tuk rattled down the sandy path between tents.</p><p>Word spread fast: The tikkiyya, a community kitchen offered by the <a href="https://wck.org/relief/chefs-for-gaza">World Central Kitchen</a> or sometimes by other volunteers and charitable initiatives, had come. Two dented metal pots sat on the back of the tuk-tuk, filled with hot mujaddara, a simple mix of brown lentils and white rice, stripped of onions or other seasonings that have become unaffordable.</p><p>Children rushed from every direction toward the sound. Suhaib, Asala’s eldest at age 9, was already running, a metal pot clanging in his hands. Asala followed close behind. She told me that she accompanied her children to the tikkiya in case their pots tipped or one of them got burned. “It happens. On lentils day, the pots were boiling, and my child was burnt.”</p><p>When they got to the front of the line, she pleaded with the aid worker for an extra portion. “They gave two scoops,” she told him. “It’s not enough for seven people.” He looked away, toward the others still waiting for their ladlefuls.</p><p>In addition to Suhaib and Nada, Asala has 7-year-old Layan, 4-year-old Yusuf, and 2-and-a-half-year-old Ibrahim. Back at the tent, she gathered them in a tight circle to eat their only meal of the day. “I cannot dare leave one sleeping,” she told me. “Last time, Yusuf napped through the meal. He woke up and found nothing. He cried the rest of the day.”</p><p>Inside their tent, once this meal is done, there is no other food at all. Even baby Nada’s milk bottles sit empty, lined up beside other barren utensils. Mohammad, who once worked as a metalsmith in his father’s workshop, now finds himself unable to afford the most basic essentials. In the markets, staples such as eggs, milk, beef, and chicken have all but vanished. For what little remains, the prices are staggering. A kilogram of flour (approximately 2.2 pounds) now costs 120 shekels (approximately $32.50), the same price as a kilogram of tomatoes. Even eggplants—once a modest, accessible item—are selling for 100 shekels (about $27.00) per kilogram.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/08/gaza-aid-workers-starving/683728/?utm_source=feed">Read: ‘We’re trying to do the best we can before we die’</a>]</i></p><p>Nada weighs only 16.5 pounds. She was born under bombardment in May 2024, weighing just 4.5 pounds. “We named her after her grandmother,” Mohammad told me. “Her name means ‘dewdrops’ in Arabic. Something small, pure, and gentle. But nothing about her life has been gentle.”</p><p>The family reuses Nada’s diapers, cleaning them with rations of water. With poor nutrition, she easily picks up diseases. “She had fever, flu, diarrhea. I said maybe it’s teething. But she’s not recovering,” Asala told me. “We have no medicine. Even soap has vanished. Doctors said, with these conditions, it is hard to recover, since the immune system is weak and vulnerable.”</p>

<div class="credit">Ghada Abdulfattah</div><div class="caption">Asala, Mohammad, and their five children</div>
<div class="credit"></div><div class="caption"></div><p>The family has been displaced five times—from Wadi As-Salqa, southeast of Deir al-Balah, to a school on Salah al-Din road; then to Mashala, west of Deir al-Balah; to Khan Younis; and now to a makeshift tent in the middle of Deir al-Balah. Their shelter is a patch of plastic and tarp held down by rocks, near the edge of a displacement zone in southwest Deir al-Balah, where Israel was engaged in a military operation from July 20 to 22.</p><p>“Shrapnel has come to us,” Asala told me. A child in the next tent was injured. “I worry every day they will order us to leave again,” she said. “Where will we go?”</p><p>Asala told me that her children still remember the old days, and the tastes of foods she used to cook. “Fridays used to be family days,” Asala remembers. “My husband brought fish. We cooked chicken. The children remind me of that.” Suhaib used to excel in school. He still asks for a laptop—just to learn on it. Layan talks about university.</p><p>In the late evening, Asala’s children again started asking about food. She tried to hush Nada with water, and to distract the others, telling them that the tikkiya might come again tomorrow, or the camp committee might give them something. In past weeks, Asala would sometimes walk to her neighbor’s tents to ask if anyone had a spare loaf of bread. The answer was almost always “no.”</p><p>Now and then Mohammad hears about aid trucks passing through the border to supply organizations such as the World Food Program. He joins the crowds of men who follow these trucks, but he often returns empty-handed. At times, Asala has followed him secretly. “I just want to bring something home,” she told me. She described a dangerous scramble, crowds swelling with desperation: “Some bring sticks. Some guns.” Once, her husband returned with a few cans of tomato paste he found on the ground, crushed under people’s feet. “They were cracked open and mixed with sand. I took it anyway.”</p><p>The scene around the airdrops can be equally abject. On Wednesday, Suhaib and Yusuf ran toward a descending parachute, yelling: “Throw something here! Throw something here!” Nothing came.</p><p>Asala chased it, too. “I left the tent. I wasn’t thinking. I ran barefoot. When I reached where it fell, it was gone. This is what they’ve turned us into,” she said. “I felt humiliated. We are sentenced to live like this.”</p></div>
