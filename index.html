                        <div class="content"><p><i>This is an edition of </i>The Atlantic<i> Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. </i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/?utm_source=feed"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></p><p>Awarding superlatives in the Donald Trump era is risky. Knowing when one of his moves is the biggest or worst or most aggressive is challenging‚Äînot only because Trump himself always opts for the most over-the-top description, but because each new peak or trough prepares the way for the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/trump-veterans-day-speech-vermin-reelection/676137/?utm_source=feed">next</a>. So I‚Äôll eschew a specific modifier and simply say this: The past five days have been deeply distressing for the truth as a force in restraining authoritarian governance.</p><p>In a different era, each of these stories would have defined months, if not more, of a presidency. Coming in such quick succession, they risk being subsumed by one another and sinking into the continuous din of the Trump presidency. Collectively, they represent an assault on several kinds of truth: in reporting and news, in statistics, and in the historical record.</p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/07/31/trump-impeachment-smithsonian/"><i>The Washington Post</i></a><i> </i>revealed that the Smithsonian National Museum of American History had removed references to Trump‚Äôs record-setting two impeachments from an exhibit‚Äôs section on presidential scandals. The deletion reportedly came as part of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/06/09/smithsonian-kim-sajet-national-portrait-gallery/">review</a> to find supposed bias in Smithsonian museums. Now, referring to Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton, the exhibit states that ‚Äúonly three presidents have seriously faced removal.‚Äù This is false‚ÄîTrump came closer to Senate conviction than Clinton did. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/us/politics/smithsonian-trump-impeachments-exhibit.html">Smithsonian</a> says the material about Trump‚Äôs impeachments was meant to be temporary (though it had been in place since 2021), and that references will be restored in an upcoming update.</p><p>If only that seemed like a safe bet. The administration, including Vice President J. D. Vance, an ex officio member of the Smithsonian board, has been pressuring the Smithsonian to align its messages with the president‚Äôs <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/">political priorities</a>, claiming that the institution has ‚Äúcome under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.‚Äù The White House attempted to fire the head of the National Portrait Gallery, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/arts/design/trump-smithsonian-kim-sajet-fired.html">it likely did not have the power to do.</a> (She later resigned.) Meanwhile, as my colleague Alexandra Petri points out, the administration is attempting to eliminate what it views as negativity about American history from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/trump-national-parks-tours-american-history/683754/?utm_source=feed">National Park Service sites</a>, a sometimes-absurd proposition.</p><p>During his first term, Trump criticized the removal of Confederate monuments, which he and allies claimed was revisionist history. It was not‚Äîpreserving history doesn‚Äôt require public monuments to traitors‚Äîbut tinkering with the Smithsonian is very much attempting to rewrite the official version of what happened, wiping away the impeachments like an ill-fated Kremlin apparatchik.</p><p>The day after the <i>Post </i>report, the <a href="https://cpb.org/pressroom/Corporation-Public-Broadcasting-Addresses-Operations-Following-Loss-Federal-Funding">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a> announced that it will shut down. Its demise was sealed by the administration‚Äôs successful attempt to get Congress to withdraw funding for it. Defunding CPB was a goal of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/04/project-2025-goals-trump-presidency/682597/?utm_source=feed">Project 2025</a>, because the right views PBS and NPR as biased (though the best <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise/#document/p278">evidence</a> that Project 2025 is able to marshal for this are surveys about audience political views). Although stations in major cities may be able to weather the loss of assistance, the end of CPB could create news and information deserts in more remote areas.</p><p>When Trump isn‚Äôt keeping information from reaching Americans, he‚Äôs attacking the information itself. Friday afternoon, after the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/08/trump-tariffs-economic-data/683740/?utm_source=feed">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> released revised employment statistics that suggested that the economy is not as strong as it had appeared, Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/trump-economy-bls-commissioner/683746/?utm_source=feed">response</a> was to fire the commissioner of the BLS, baselessly claiming bias. Experts had already begun to worry that government <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5424367/inflation-data-cpi-government-job-shortages">inflation data</a> were degrading under Trump. Firing the commissioner won‚Äôt make the job market any better, but it will make government statistics less trustworthy and undermine any effort by policy makers, including Trump‚Äôs own aides, to improve the economy. <i>The New York Times</i>‚Äô <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/03/business/trump-bls-firing-economic-reports.html">Ben Casselman</a> catalogs plenty of examples of leaders who attacked economic statistics and ended up paying a price for it. (Delving into these examples might provide Trump with a timely warning, but as the editors of <i>The Atlantic </i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/?utm_source=feed">wrote</a> in 2016, ‚Äúhe appears not to read.‚Äù)</p><p>The next day, the Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro to be the top prosecutor for the District of Columbia. Though Pirro previously served as a prosecutor and judge in New York State, her top credential for the job‚Äîas with so many of her <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/fox-news-rebound/680815/?utm_source=feed">administration colleagues</a>‚Äîis her run as a Fox News personality. Prior to the January 6 riot, she was a strong proponent of the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. Her statements were prominent in a successful defamation case against Fox, and evidence in the case included a discussion of why executives yanked her off the air on November 7, 2020. ‚ÄúThey took her off cuz she was being crazy,‚Äù Tucker Carlson‚Äôs executive producer wrote in a <a href="https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/D8File/2023/02/16/2023-02-16-redacted-dominion-opening-sj-brief.pdf#page=36">text</a>. ‚ÄúOptics are bad. But she is crazy.‚Äù</p><p>This means that a person who either lied or couldn‚Äôt tell fact from fiction, and whom even Fox News apparently didn‚Äôt trust to avoid a false claim, is being entrusted with power over federal prosecutions in the nation‚Äôs capital. (Improbably, she <i>still </i>might be an improvement over her interim <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/04/ed-martin-russian-tv-trump/682488/?utm_source=feed">predecessor</a>.)</p><p>Even as unqualified prosecutors are being confirmed, the Trump White House is seeking retribution against Jack Smith, the career Justice Department attorney who led Trump‚Äôs aborted prosecutions on charges related to subverting the 2020 election and hoarding of documents at Mar-a-Lago. The Office of Special Counsel‚Äîthe government watchdog that is led at the moment, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/marco-rubio-jobs-trump-administration/682822/?utm_source=feed">for some reason</a>, by the <a href="https://insidetrade.com/daily-news/greer-serving-acting-head-special-counsel-government-ethics-offices">U.S. trade representative</a>‚Äîis investigating whether Smith violated the Hatch Act, which bars some executive-branch officials from certain political actions while they‚Äôre on the job, by charging Trump. Never mind that the allegations against Trump were for overt behavior. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/02/jack-smith-trump-prosecutor-investigation-special-counsel/">Kathleen Clark</a>, a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, told the <i>Post </i>she had never seen the OSC investigate a prosecutor for prosecutorial decisions. The charges against Trump were dropped when he won the 2024 election. If anything, rather than prosecutions being used to interfere with elections, Trump used the election to interfere with prosecutions.</p><p>This is a bleak series of events. But although facts can be suppressed, they cannot be so easily changed. Even if Trump can bowdlerize the BLS, that won‚Äôt change the underlying economy. As Democrats discovered during the Biden administration, you can‚Äôt talk voters out of bad feelings about the economy using accurate statistics; that wouldn‚Äôt be any easier with bogus ones. Trump is engaged in a broad assault on truth, but truth has ways of fighting back.</p><p><b>Related:</b></p><ul>

The creature in question is Labubu‚Äîa soft-bellied plushie that the Chinese company Pop Mart began distributing in 2019, and that has, in the past year, gained hordes of admirers. In 2024, Pop Mart reported a more than 700 percent increase in the stuffie‚Äôs sales. People have been doling out anywhere from about $30 to <a href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/hk/lifestyle/art-plus-design/most-expensive-labubu-dolls-auction/">$150,000</a> a toy. At <a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/the-hottest-party-in-new-york-right-now-labubu-raves">Brooklyn raves</a>, adults hop around under neon lights with Labubus clipped to their belt loops. The devotion, at times, has turned almost ferocious; Pop Mart decided to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/business/labubu-uk-sales-fights-intl-scli-gbr">suspend in-person sales</a> of Labubu in the United Kingdom after reports of chaos at stores.</p><p>Commentators have offered all sorts of theories as to why Labubu has become a sensation. One factor might be scarcity: Each new Labubu release on Pop Mart‚Äôs online store tends to sell out in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/style/labubus-pop-mart-toys.html">minutes</a>. Another might be surprise: The plushie arrives in a blind box. (It could be pink or <a href="https://figpalace.com/blogs/guide/top-6-popular-monsters-labubu-vinyl?srsltid=AfmBOoqfafo57h_R7x5oTfWsmTNbb8Otq7AVe-TLHz1eXdnmoHhq3jmC">gray</a>; wear overalls or hold a Coke.) Some people have suggested that the Labubu hype is a product of a trickle-down <a href="https://www.filmfare.com/features/celebs-who-love-the-labubu-doll-trend-sharvari-rihanna-and-more-74569.html">celebrity</a> effect, or that the toy has become a <a href="https://xtramagazine.com/culture/labubu-doll-gay-popmart-274530">gay icon</a>.</p><p>But the way I see it, the cult of Labubu is simply an extension of the phenomenon known as ‚Äú<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/04/adult-stuffed-animal-revival/678012/?utm_source=feed">kidulthood,‚Äù </a>in which the boundary between childhood and adulthood keeps growing fuzzier and fuzzier. In the past few years, more American adults have been buying stuffed animals‚Äîsome, researchers have told me, in an effort to reject staid versions of adulthood and inject more play into grown-up life. These adults have usually kept their plushies at home, relegating them to bookshelves and beds. Labubus, though, are ‚Äúpublic displays of cuteness,‚Äù Erica Kanesaka, an Emory University professor and cute-studies scholar, told me in an email. Devotees carry Labubu into subway cars, office cubicles, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ellechimb/video/7529030399318691086?q=labubu%20at%20work&amp;t=1753286884513">dental schools. They </a>clock into shifts at <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@melaanieg/video/7529955674864864526?q=labubu%20at%20work&amp;t=1753286884513">KFC</a> with the toy literally attached to their hip, and take it along for their workdays as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chicagobears/video/7530067609908169998?lang=en&amp;q=labubu&amp;t=1753303157643">football players</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pilotkjerstin/video/7527763556775808269?lang=en&amp;q=labubu&amp;t=1753303157643">airline pilots</a>.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/04/adult-stuffed-animal-revival/678012/?utm_source=feed">Read: Welcome to kidulthood</a>]</i></p><p>Adults in other countries‚ÄîJapan, perhaps most notably‚Äîhave long worn objects featuring cute characters, such as Hello Kitty, out and about, hooked to bags and key chains. In the 1990s, it <a href="https://features.japantimes.co.jp/hellokitty/">wasn‚Äôt uncommon</a> to see white-collar Japanese salarymen with Hello Kitty accessories dangling from their phones. The trend, Simon May, a philosopher and the author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780691271149"><i>The Power of Cute</i></a>, told me, might have been born of a postwar rejection of overt aggression: After World War II, cute aesthetics were one way that Japan revamped its public-facing image. The country, May said, changed its self-presentation ‚Äú180 degrees from militarism to pacifism.‚Äù But in the United States, loving cute objects has historically been written off as escapism at best and a worrying swing toward infancy at worst. Adults who embraced childlike things were ‚Äúseen to be irresponsibly regressive, morally immature, and refusing to play their full part in society,‚Äù May said in an email after we spoke. As recently as 2020, in an article about plushies, one writer self-consciously <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adult-sleep-stuffed-animal_n_5f469ac3c5b6cf66b2b1eece">described</a> her stuffed hound as her ‚Äúdeep dark secret.‚Äù</p><p>Yet, as I‚Äôve previously reported, this defensiveness about loving cute objects has been gradually dissipating, part of a century-long evolution in which childhood has come to be seen as a protected life stage. Nowadays, May said, ‚Äúto be childlike also has an increasingly positive connotation in terms of openness to ideas and freedom from dogmatism.‚Äù At the same time, attitudes about what it means to be an adult are shifting. Many have assumed that children are supposed to ‚Äúgrow out of vulnerability‚Äù when they become adults, Sandra Chang-Kredl, a professor at Concordia University, in Montreal, who has studied adults‚Äô attachments to stuffed animals, told me. But more and more, people are pushing back on that idea. Years ago, ‚Äúit would have been hard to admit that, let‚Äôs say, <i>Oh, I have anxiety</i>,‚Äù Chang-Kredl said. ‚ÄúToday, there‚Äôs no shame involved in it.‚Äù<b> </b></p><p>Pop Mart has capitalized on this transformation, marketing Labubus‚Äîand its other collectibles‚Äîspecifically to young adults. The company‚Äôs social-media posts seem to be aimed at Monday-hating, coffee-drinking workers who might <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFFVy46pNC3/?img_index=1">log in to Zoom meetings</a> from disastrously messy rooms or prefer to be outside, playing with buddies (or toys), rather than reporting to an office. Evidence suggests that this approach has been successful; one analysis of Pop Mart‚Äôs web traffic <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1612767/pop-mart-website-visitors-age-group/">found</a> that 39 percent of visitors to the online store in April ranged in age from 25 to 34.</p><p>Shame dies hard, though, which might be another reason Labubu has gained traction. Within the realm of cute things, a demonic-looking stuffie is more ‚Äúugly-cute‚Äù‚Äîadorable, monstrous, deliberately weird. (Ugly-cuteness is also by no means a new phenomenon; think of the pygmy-hippo sensation <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/moo-deng-pygmy-hippo-birthday-viral-videos-thailand-zoo-rcna217195">Moo Deng</a>, toys such as UglyDolls and Cabbage Patch Kids, or the eternal appeal of the pug.) People ‚Äúfeel that they themselves are a little bit edgy,‚Äù Joshua Dale, a cute-studies professor at Chuo University, in Tokyo, told me, ‚Äúfor liking something that some people don‚Äôt like.‚Äù</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/06/charli-xcx-sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-summer-pop/678760/?utm_source=feed">Read: The ‚ÄòEspresso‚Äô theory of gender relations</a>]</i></p><p>As with any popular trend, Labubu does have its haters‚Äîor at least some tongue-in-cheek provocateurs. People have suggested (semi-jokingly) that the toy is possessed, possibly by a demon called Pazuzu. The singer Katy Perry, at a recent concert in Australia, used her mic to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qwwNJhVu9c0">smack</a> a Labubu out of a fan‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúNo Labubus!‚Äù she commanded sternly. Still, Labubu‚Äôs creepy-cute duality does feel very of this moment, in line with a certain strain of the culture that seeks to undercut anything that feels too buttoned-up. Consider the popularity of ‚Äúbrat‚Äù‚Äîan irony-tinged aesthetic that embraces the messy and ugly-cute over the prepped and polished. Last year, my colleague Spencer Kornhaber <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/06/charli-xcx-sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-summer-pop/678760/?utm_source=feed">described</a> the ‚Äúbrat‚Äù mood as ‚Äúa little immature, a little selfish, a little <i>nasty</i>.‚Äù He also noted that the singer Charli XCX, whose songs affirm that the party-girl life has no age limit, and pop artists such as Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan seem to be making music offering ‚Äúthe assurance that <i>growing up</i>, in the conventional sense, is just optional.‚Äù</p><p>Wearing Labubu, especially on a designer purse or a backpack meant for grown-ups, is a choice that speaks in a similar register. It signals a ‚Äúplayful attitude to life,‚Äù May told me, ‚Äúa winking at the world.‚Äù Monday will come around again, with its dreaded wake-up alarms and emails. But according to the logic of kidulthood, you might feel a tiny bit better if you bring a devilish tchotchke to that 9 a.m. meeting.</p></div>

The fact that Hamas ignited this chain of events, and that it could end the war if wanted to, does nothing to absolve Israel of its primary role in the food crisis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs government bears responsibility for policies that are now depriving Gazans of adequate nourishment and may soon kill them in staggering numbers. It was his cabinet that imposed a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/04/30/israel-siege-gaza-food-crisis/">blockade</a> on Gaza starting on March 2. The measure was eventually reversed under international pressure. Still, the subsequent damage was a deliberate choice, because even after Israel lifted its siege, it further limited the ability of the United Nations to distribute relief.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/food-aid-gaza-israel-ghf/683658/?utm_source=feed">Read: Food aid in Gaza has become a horror</a>]</i></p><p>Israel executed these policies in the name of achieving Netanyahu‚Äôs <a href="https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-congress-gaza-hamas-israel-6ea5daf3cd1988b0ad6e874bd450f9bf">implausible goal</a> of ‚Äútotal victory.‚Äù Food, in his government‚Äôs <a href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-862878?utm_source=chatgpt.com">analysis</a>, had become a weapon used by Hamas to sustain its fighters, reward loyalty, and replenish its armaments through black-market profiteering. The United Nations, Israeli officials believed, was at best excessively tolerant of terrorists in Gaza. By wresting control of aid distribution from the world organization, Israel hoped to cut Hamas off from one of its last remaining sources of power.</p><p>But the policy has failed on its own terms. Hamas is no closer to surrendering or releasing hostages than before Israel embarked on its campaign of deprivation. A movement animated by theological fervor‚Äîand strengthened by the spectacle of civilian suffering‚Äîcannot be starved into submission. And now that the toll of hunger is becoming so clear, Israel has an obligation to reverse course as quickly as possible.</p><p>When there is hunger, the blazingly obvious solution is food. Humanitarian groups have a clich√© for what‚Äôs needed in Gaza: ‚Äúflooding the zone‚Äù with food. That would require Israel to lift restrictions and bureaucratic impediments that it has imposed on the UN agencies it loathes.</p><p>Flooding the zone is not just a humanitarian imperative; it is a strategic one for Israel. The food crisis is alienating bedrock allies in the U.S. Congress. When Israel launched its response to the atrocities of October 7, with the goal of dismantling Hamas, I considered the war just and necessary. But international law prohibits some tactics in order to protect the innocent and to prevent the perverse exigencies of conflict from disfiguring the soul of the warrior. Even if Israel is prepared to endure international isolation, allegiances it once considered unbreakable won‚Äôt survive famine. By flooding the zone, Israel would be rescuing itself.</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">Just before Israel</span> imposed its blockade on Gaza in early March, a cease-fire prevailed. During the calm, the <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-price-of-flour-shows-the-hunger-crisis-in-gaza-israel-war-hamas">price of flour</a>‚Äîthe clearest indicator of a population‚Äôs nutritional access‚Äîplummeted from about $135 for a 25-kilogram sack to just $14 in February. The United Nations, along with the nongovernmental organizations that it coordinates, imported <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/gaza-palestine-food-aid-e74c68de?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiCxbjeeZmZ07rqFH3F4iIDCpUgUCZmoSYPsGHvwlGjVdAuHNGLSwa_XoXqELw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68897352&amp;gaa_sig=TavTTNm-a5RYzSgguuWlbne0rXX6QV4Us1G2Um_TKSifvKdw20Zd73qVTO6BdRdRzhUo8ZF-UWm3tVMKoy_wwg%3D%3D">more aid</a> during that period than at any point in the previous eight months: 295,120 tons in total. Although this was hardly a cornucopia, the surge of food and medicine averted large-scale starvation.</p><p>The role the United Nations played in this effort wasn‚Äôt unusual. In major humanitarian crises caused by war‚Äîfor example, in Sudan and Ukraine‚Äîthe UN serves as the primary mechanism for coordinating the care of civilians displaced by conflict. In Gaza, its role ran even deeper: For decades, the UN had provided not just emergency relief but also the basic infrastructure of daily life‚Äîeducation, housing, food.</p><p>Even as Israel and the UN collaborated on the movement of trucks and the flow of aid, they regarded each other as hostile entities. Israel had legitimate reasons for suspicion. For years, schools administered by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza used <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-gazans-return-to-school-study-finds-their-pa-textbooks-still-rife-with-incitement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">textbooks</a> glorifying violent resistance.

It didn‚Äôt just block the entry of all goods, including food. That move preluded a string of policies that seem intended to permanently push the UN out of Gaza.</p><p>By summer, Israel had refused to renew the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-says-israel-has-refused-to-renew-visas-for-heads-of-at-least-3-agencies-in-gaza/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">visas</a> of top officials at three UN agencies operating in Gaza. (These officials had publicly condemned Israel‚Äôs obstructionism, voicing accusations of genocide, collective punishment, and political sabotage‚Äîrhetoric that infuriated Israeli leaders.) Aid groups navigated a growing tangle of permits and bureaucratic impositions that made the UN‚Äôs relief efforts in Gaza <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/109772/israel-humanitarian-ngo-guidelines/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">unworkable</a>. New restrictions gave the government the right to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/15/israel-palestinians-aid-groups-registration/">demand the names and contact details of Palestinian staffers</a> and ban any group whose employees have questioned Israel‚Äôs existence as a Jewish, democratic state.</p><p>To replace the UN presence, Israel worked with the Trump administration to hastily design a new system to feed Gaza. Where the old international agencies were run by technical experts and experienced professionals, the new system was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/06/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-failure/683053/?utm_source=feed">concocted by management consultants</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/21/gaza-aid-ghf/">private security contractors</a> under the aegis of a newly created nonprofit, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Where the UN had tried to address the full spectrum of civilian needs‚Äîmedicine, sanitation, nutrition‚Äîthe GHF largely focuses on food, distributing boxes and bags in just <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c74d86c-330f-4184-9e15-6de4debe0f75">four sites</a>, all in areas fully controlled by the Israeli military, none of them in northern Gaza. This plan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-israel-human-rights-groups">transgressed</a> fundamental principles that guide humanitarian work, and the UN announced that it wanted nothing to do with GHF.</p><p>The result was predictably <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/us-israel-gaza-aid-deaths-12d3fb35?mod=article_inline">disastrous</a>. Hundreds of Palestinians <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/killings-palestinians-seeking-food-gaza-continue-starvation-deepens-enar">were shot</a> while mobbing soldiers during chaotic food distributions. Whatever the faults of the UN, it remains the world‚Äôs most capable relief agency. And in Gaza, it had a network of warehouses, bakeries, and kitchens and a pool of local employees. Flooding the zone is simply not possible unless Israel restores the visas of international-aid workers and allows them to operate without the labyrinthine restrictions currently paralyzing their work.</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">A primary impediment</span> to providing ample food is epistemic closure. That is, many Israelis simply don‚Äôt believe the warnings of famine, because they doubt the veracity of the evidence. They say that the UN has a history of predicting catastrophes in Gaza that never come to pass. But this time is genuinely different. The price of a sack of flour, which by the end of May had <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-price-of-flour-shows-the-hunger-crisis-in-gaza-israel-war-hamas">skyrocketed</a> to about $500, tells the story. And although intermittent shortages do not always lead to famine, the nature of a prolonged crisis is that it grinds down the resilience of both the human body and entire communities.</p><p>Jeremy Konyndyk, the head of Refugees International, who oversaw disaster relief for the Obama administration, told me: ‚ÄúIn the early months of the war, if you cut off all the food, people are starting from a place where they‚Äôre still healthy. They still have money and resources. They have assets they can sell. There are still stockpiles of food. So there‚Äôs a lot more of what we in humanitarian terms would call a ‚Äòcoping mechanism.‚Äô‚Äù But those mechanisms, he said, are now gone.</p><p>That‚Äôs true not just for the recipients of aid but also for those delivering it. Relief networks <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/08/gaza-aid-workers-starving/683728/?utm_source=feed">rely heavily on Gazans</a> to move and distribute food. ‚ÄúLike on an airplane,‚Äù Konyndyk said, ‚Äúyou put on your own mask before helping others. That applies here. We need to stabilize the aid providers in order to enable them to scale up the operation.‚Äù</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/corrupt-bargain-behind-gazas-catastrophe/683690/?utm_source=feed">Read: The corrupt bargain behind Gaza‚Äôs catastrophe</a>]</i></p><p>The thoroughfares that would carry food to the hungry are in no better shape. Sixty-eight percent of Gaza‚Äôs roads are <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/considerations-delivery-humanitarian-aid-during-ceasefire-gaza">damaged</a>, according to the UN, and will require Israeli engineers to regrade and pave them. (Israeli crews have made roads passable on multiple occasions over the course of the war.) David Satterfield, a longtime American diplomat who coordinated the distribution of aid in Gaza during the Biden administration, told me that the continued warfare has ‚Äújust physically disrupted the ability of aid implementers to get their stuff to warehouses, from warehouses to distribution points.‚Äù</p><p>As hunger deepens, trucks navigating these roads become ever more vulnerable to mobs desperate to plunder the contents. Crowds descend to loot out of fear that waiting in line means getting nothing. Humanitarians call this ‚Äúself-distribution.‚Äù There is no functioning government to secure the convoys. Even if Gaza were inundated with food, the looting would likely persist‚Äîuntil the supply became so reliable that people stopped fearing it might vanish.</p><p>Every image of a child with protruding ribs is both a human tragedy and a propaganda victory for Hamas‚Äîand proof of how a just war badly lost the plot. I believed in Israel‚Äôs casus belli. I don‚Äôt believe in this. No justification can redeem the immorality of a policy built on deprivation. As Gaza braces for the worst, Israel still has a narrow window to correct its course. By flooding the zone, Israel has one last chance to redeem itself.</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p class="dropcap">J<span class="smallcaps">im Henson‚Äôs Creature Shop</span> has sat, for the past 16 years, on the fourth floor of an office building in Long Island City, New York, behind a metal door that looks like any other. When I opened it one gray morning after the holidays, I was greeted by a plastic Christmas tree hung with fake fish skeletons and desiccated banana peels, Oscar leering nearby from his can, and a brown, fuzzy blob sitting on a table. At first I thought it might be a complete Muppet, until I saw, a few yards beyond, a matching brown, fuzzy, headless body. As the archivist Karen Falk began to lead me on a tour of the workshop‚Äîdrawers of googly eyes, noses, and ‚Äúspecial facial hair‚Äù; filing cabinets for ‚Äúfur‚Äù and ‚Äúslippery sleezy‚Äù; a stack of banker‚Äôs boxes, one marked ‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù another ‚ÄúBoober‚Äù‚ÄîI looked back, briefly, to catch the bulbous nose and round eyes of Junior Gorg from <em>Fraggle Rock</em> staring at me, or perhaps at his own body, waiting to be reunited.</p><p>‚ÄúThere are only three Snuffleupagi in the world,‚Äù Falk told me, gesturing toward a puppet near the entrance that she said was kind of an extra, deployed when Snuffleupagus needs a family member on set next to him. I reached out to give Snuffy‚Äôs relation a little pet‚Äîhis soft brown fur, curly and dense like a poodle‚Äôs, was overlain with orange feathers‚Äîand scribbled a note: ‚Äúremarkably lifelike.‚Äù <em>For a what?</em> I later asked myself. <em>For a giant woolly mammoth cum anteater puppet?</em> But the space made it easy to slip across the human-Muppet divide and into Henson‚Äôs world, where the realness of the puppets is sacrosanct. When I asked to take a picture of the decapitated Junior Gorg, just for my notes, Falk looked at me as if I‚Äôd asked to check under Miss Piggy‚Äôs dress. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt allow photos of things like that, Muppets without heads,‚Äù she tutted, and ushered me to another part of the workshop, where a handful of archival boxes had been set aside for me.</p><p>After a great loss, some people find themselves communing with nature, at the seaside or deep in a forest. Others turn to spirituality, toward a temple or church. Me? I‚Äôd come to grieve with the Muppets.</p><p class="dropcap">M<span class="smallcaps">y father, Marshall,</span> amassed many accolades over the course of his career‚Äîa gold record for playing bluegrass banjo on the <em>Deliverance</em> soundtrack; an Oscar for co-writing the script of <em>Annie Hall</em>; a Tony nomination for Best Book for the musical <em>Jersey Boys</em>, which won Best Musical in 2006 (and an Olivier Award, too)‚Äîbut way cooler to me, as a kid, was the fact that for a brief stint, long before I was born, he‚Äôd been part of Henson‚Äôs crew.</p><p>For much of my life, I knew little about the specifics. I do remember one time being feverish and crying for a Kermit doll after a doctor‚Äôs appointment, even though, despite Dad‚Äôs involvement in the show, I can‚Äôt remember ever watching any <em>Muppets</em>, or even <em>Sesame Street</em>, at home. The local toy store was all sold out, so Dad called in a favor, and we headed to the old Muppet offices on the Upper East Side to pick one up. While we were waiting, I watched, slack-jawed, as puppet makers working on a new creation pulled googly eyes out of thin drawers, one after another, a fever dream come to life and branded in my memory like a surrealist madeleine. After that, the Muppets all but receded from my life.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/the-secret-life-of-grief/281992/?utm_source=feed">Read: The secret life of grief</a>]</i></p><p>That changed after my father got sick last year, when my daily life became not just a logistical mire‚Äîmanaging therapy appointments, speaking with doctors‚Äîbut also one of constant dread: about which Dad I‚Äôd find when I walked into his room each day, his personality somehow refracted, as if I were looking at it through a prism; about whether a middle-of-the-night phone call might signify an Earth-tilting inflection point; about how devastating it was going to be to navigate the world without the beloved father I‚Äôd always looked up to.</p><p>At the end of each day, like any well-adjusted individual faced with looming, profound change, I chose to run screaming as far away from reality as I could, which is how I ended up in the arms of the 1970s Muppets. I had no grand plan. I simply gravitated toward their fluffiness and goofiness as an antidote to grief. I sensed‚Äîrightly, it turned out‚Äîthat they‚Äôd help keep me afloat.</p><p class="dropcap">D<span class="smallcaps">ad and Henson</span> first connected through Al Gottesman, Henson‚Äôs longtime lawyer. Their mutual affinity makes total sense to me, even a generation later. They were born three years apart and grew up delighting in <em>Kukla</em>, <em>Fran and Ollie</em>, and Walt Kelly‚Äôs <em>Pogo</em> comic strip. They shared an off-kilter sense of humor and a reverence for the silly. Although I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing Dad with a puppet on his hand, when I was growing up he would put on elaborate bedtime shows for my sister and me, starring our menagerie of stuffed animals. Using a pair of needle-nose pliers from his tool case‚Äîa bulky, black-leather valise full of primary-colored screwdrivers I liked to play with, a relic from his days attending Brooklyn Technical High School to appease his practical immigrant father‚Äîhe made pince-nez out of a paper clip for my plush dachshund, Ollirina, a feisty Southern grande dame who propelled herself around by farting (my contribution); he then had her perform miraculous acts of levitation. Dad‚Äôs tried-and-true finale: shooting my Ping-Pong-ball-size plush hedgehog through a toilet-paper-roll cannon as I drumrolled on my lap. Looking back on this now that I‚Äôm a parent of three young children, I marvel that he could summon this level of creativity after dinnertime.</p><p>For a few months in the mid-‚Äô70s, Dad helped Henson write a failed Broadway Muppets revue, and what would become the pilot of <em>The Muppet Show</em>, called ‚ÄúSex and Violence With the Muppets‚Äù‚ÄîHenson‚Äôs attempt to establish the Muppets as not just for kids. Dad is listed as head writer on the script, in which Nigel, Sam the Eagle, and a few other Muppets put together a ‚ÄúSeven Deadly Sins‚Äù pageant to determine which sin is the most deadly. Although the final show evolved from the pilot‚ÄîKermit replaced Nigel as the emcee; a human guest star was added‚Äîyou can see from the script that its style was already developed, as was its tone: equal parts outlandish and sophisticated, countercultural, never talking down to the audience. Sloth arrives, of course, during the closing credits, too late to participate. One stage direction reads, simply, ‚ÄúChaos in progress.‚Äù The script established the framework with which Henson would go on to parody a vaudeville show from all angles‚Äîthe divas (Piggy), the technical malfunctions (Crazy Harry, blowing up sets left and right), the well-meaning guy trying to hold the whole ball of crazy together (Kermit).</p><p>My father‚Äôs contributions are impossible to disentangle from the general Muppetness of the script‚Äîcollaborations work, he always told me, because they are collaborative‚Äîsave for one: Despite being Brooklyn born and bred, with not a Nordic bone in his body, he is, by many accounts, the source of the Swedish Chef‚Äôs accent and nonsense lexicon, the one typified by ‚ÄúHurdy, gurdy, gurdy, bork bork bork!‚Äù The character had originated with Henson in the ‚Äô60s. Back then, he‚Äôd been German. For reasons lost to Muppetdom, at some point the character moved northwest, to a place with more centralized health care. And he needed an accent to match.</p>

<p>I loved listening to Dad parody foreign languages. He liked to throw off telemarketers by answering the phone as a hard-of-hearing woman from some indeterminate Latin American country, or as an eccentric Central European man, characterized by a sibilant, Peter Sellers‚Äìas‚ÄìStrangelove delivery that would typically escalate into a shriek and send the person on the other end skedaddling to their next call. So I was not surprised to learn that, decades earlier, Dad had apparently reduced the Henson puppeteer Frank Oz to tears by mimicking languages during brainstorming sessions. He later made an ersatz-Swedish tape for Henson to listen to on his commute into the city from his home in Bedford. ‚ÄúHe would drive to work trying to make a chicken sandwich in mock Swedish or make a turkey casserole in mock Swedish,‚Äù Henson‚Äôs son Brian told Jim‚Äôs biographer, remembering having heard my dad‚Äôs tape. ‚ÄúIt was the most ridiculous thing you had ever seen, and people at traffic lights used to stop and sort of look at him a little crazy.‚Äù</p><p>All of this I learned from books, from interviews with Muppet staffers, and by emailing Falk, the Henson archivist. But the bulk of my embedding in Muppetdom over the past year involved watching <em>The Muppet Show</em> with my husband and three kids on weekend evenings, our world cocooned between the real, live present and a completely nonsensical 1970s. I‚Äôd slice up some apples and we‚Äôd cackle together as Rita Moreno flung a noodly Muppet man around set in a particularly violent tango; as Zero Mostel, only mildly indignant that a Muppet was eating him during his cold open, helped wash down his own arm with a little water; as Gene Kelly taught Kermit to tap-dance on the piano.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/06/dad-urday-fatherhood-ritual/683135/?utm_source=feed">Read: The father-daughter routine that transformed our family life</a>]</i></p><p>Given what I‚Äôd learned, was it a cosmic sign that my youngest, just 3 years old, started to develop an obsession with the Swedish Chef? He took to running around the apartment, crowing his bastardized version of the Chef‚Äôs already bastardized Swedish and then, mimicking his new Nordic hero, flinging into the air whatever he had handy. Sometimes it was a stuffed animal; other times it was hard objects, which would necessitate a stern lecture (after my husband and I had taken cover) about the dangers of throwing things up, because they tend to come down, even if the Chef‚Äôs flapjacks do not. After my son got a Swedish Chef action-figure set that included a small chicken and a handful of cooking tools, he would sit on the ground, brow furrowed in concentration, making the cleaver-wielding chef hop after the chicken‚Äîor sometimes, in keeping with Muppet sensibility, vice versa.</p><p>My daughters became obsessed with ‚ÄúPigs in Space,‚Äù a recurring Muppet sketch parodying <em>Star Trek</em> and other space operas of the 1960s and ‚Äô70s. They erupted in cheers whenever the USS Swinetrek flew across the screen, indicating that the sketch was back again. The setup is that three pigs are flying through the cosmos‚ÄîCaptain Link Hogthrob, Dr. Julius Strangepork, and Miss Piggy as first mate‚Äîand ‚Ä¶ nothing really happens. John Cleese shows up as a pirate and tries to make a call from a payphone on the ship, while his parrot, who is in love with him, gripes that Cleese is neglecting her and should take her to dinner with all his doubloons. The ship is invaded by two alien beings, who turn out to be the Swedish Chef and his chicken, and after they leave, the pigs get bored. When the USS Swinetrek nears the end of the universe, where its crew will finally discover the meaning and purpose of life, the dinner bell rings, and the pigs get sidetracked. Miss Piggy is routinely degraded, asked by the boars to do the laundry or make more swill, though the audience understands that she‚Äôs smarter and tougher than her male co-stars.</p><p>According to Oz, Miss Piggy‚Äôs puppeteer, her toughness was hard-won. In multiple interviews, he has spoken about his need to understand the complete biographies of the characters he portrayed, even if viewers don‚Äôt share that need. In Oz‚Äôs mind, Miss Piggy was born on a farm, loved her father very much, and was grief-stricken when he died in a tractor accident. As her mother‚Äôs subsequent suitors turned their attention to Miss Piggy, a single path forward emerged: to leave. She was later forced to do some things she wasn‚Äôt proud of as she clawed her way to diva-dom, including appearing in a bacon commercial.</p><p>Does any of that come through the screen as she floats around in outer space? I suppose that, for some viewers, it does‚Äîthat having a deep understanding of Miss Piggy‚Äôs character somehow enabled Oz and the other puppeteers to present her simulated world as real enough that the audience would jump into it with her, feetfirst, willingly suspending disbelief.</p><p>Or maybe that‚Äôs not why it works. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so <em>weird</em>,‚Äù my third grader said to me one night, with a snort. ‚ÄúLike, why are there even pigs <em>in</em> space?‚Äù</p><p class="dropcap">I <span class="smallcaps">didn‚Äôt experience</span> what others warned me I might, after the months of decline that led to Dad‚Äôs death late last year: picking up the phone to call him and forgetting that there would be no one on the other end, looking up from the sidewalk at the window where he worked for decades, expecting to see the light on and being knocked sideways that it was dark. I never forgot. I never expected the light to be on. But occasionally, I‚Äôd find myself dropping from one reality straight through to another, something most likely aided by my living just eight blocks from where I grew up. My neighborhood is saturated with memories spanning my whole life.</p><p>Passing a street corner, I would suddenly reverse-age four decades and see Dad‚Äôs belt buckle sliding along my tricycle‚Äôs handlebars, because I was so hot and sweaty and tired that I simply couldn‚Äôt pedal one more inch, and he was pulling me around that corner, home. I‚Äôd be running the Lower Loop in Central Park, where we used to take our daily afternoon walks, and I‚Äôd pass a busker playing the fiddle and have to stop, hands on knees, to catch my breath, remembering the Flatt and Scruggs Dad played through his computer speakers. These temporal shifts through eras were uncontrolled, unexpected, all-encompassing. My scrim between reality and memory, truth and simulation, had become porous, faulty. Like the Swedish Chef, who starts making a turtle soup only to find that the turtle has woken up and is trying to escape, my reality was pitched, slightly, on its axis.</p><p>The first time one of these temporal shifts through eras, one of these free falls from today back to childhood, happened was a few nights after the burial. My husband, kids, and I gathered, the children freshly showered and damp-haired, and put on the Muppets, as we‚Äôd done, at that point, for months. The episode featured Se√±or Wences, the ventriloquist whose main act involved Johnny, a boy made from Wences‚Äôs hand, on which he stuck two googly eyes, and on top of which he draped a ridiculous orange wig. His other star performers were a bespectacled chicken named Cecilia (Wences: ‚ÄúSecond name?‚Äù; Cecilia: ‚ÄúChicken‚Äù) and Pedro, a surly talking head (literally just a head, not an MSNBC type) who, after a train accident that decapitated the poor puppet, spent his life, disembodied, in a box.</p><p>The episode‚Äôs conceit was that Kermit has decided to do something new: a puppet show! ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a complete change of pace, folks,‚Äù he said to cheers. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs a real first!‚Äù Toward the end, Wences held up an egg and asked Cecilia Chicken to identify it. As she replied, softly and directly, ‚ÄúMy son‚Äù (rhymes with <em>moan</em>), a memory of childhood weekend breakfasts welled up from deep in my subconscious, collapsing time just as the puppets on-screen were collapsing their simulation. I saw the kitchen table, the oval wooden one my father had waxed by hand until it shone. I felt its slight stickiness beneath my hands. And by the stove was Dad, apron halved and tied around his waist, holding up an egg reverently, sighing, lovingly pronouncing it ‚Äúmy son!‚Äù in Salamancan-inflected English, then cracking it, with a flourish, into a cast-iron skillet.</p><p><em>He used to do that with eggs.</em></p><p>I‚Äôd completely forgotten. For a moment, I stayed there at the kitchen table, giggling. I stayed with the feeling of being closer to my children‚Äôs age than middle age; closer to those evenings spent cross-legged and damp-haired myself, watching my dad turn stuffed animals into performers; closer still to a moment years before my birth, when, across town at the Henson studios, in a healthy body with long legs kicked up on the desk in front of him, my dad held a bulky tape recorder to his mouth, paused, then started up for the first time in ersatz Swedish, the beginning of a thread that would reach out, decades later, and tether him to me.</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p>Last month, a group of seven U.S. generals and admirals‚Äîincluding the top admiral in charge of U.S. military operations in the Asia-Pacific region‚Äîprepared to travel to the Aspen Security Forum, in Colorado. Security officials had spoken at the annual conference for years, including during Donald Trump‚Äôs first term, and were set to discuss topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the future of AI, and threats from China. But a day before the forum began, the officers‚Äô staff got calls from the Pentagon telling them to stay away. <a href="https://x.com/DODResponse/status/1946277249138692531">On social media</a>, Sean Parnell, the Defense Department‚Äôs top spokesperson, later made clear why: The forum, he said, was ‚Äúhosted by an organization that promotes the evils of globalism, disdain for America, and hatred for our great president, Donald J. Trump.‚Äù</p><p>Aspen, it turned out, was only the beginning. Within days, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered the DOD to vet all future event attendance by any defense official. In a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/24/pentagon-think-tank-events-ban-00473621">statement to <em>Politico</em></a>, Parnell declared that the move was meant to ‚Äúensure the Department of Defense is not lending its name and credibility to organizations, forums, and events that run counter to the values of this administration.‚Äù (The Aspen Institute, which sponsors the security forum, describes itself as nonpartisan.)</p><p>Parnell‚Äôs characterization of the new policy was vague, but it represented an abrupt departure from long-established DOD practices, and an important shift in the way that the military engages with the outside world: A Pentagon that has already grown more insular under Hegseth could end up cutting itself off from thinkers and ideas beyond the building, or at least those with which the administration disagrees.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/pentagon-hegseth-think-tanks/683692/?utm_source=feed">Tom Nichols: The Pentagon against the think tanks</a>]</i></p><p>Military personnel and conference planners I spoke with described the decision as the latest battle in a broader war on ideas at the Pentagon under Hegseth. Earlier this year, the DOD eliminated the Office of Net Assessment, which had been created in the 1970s as a hub for strategic analysts to produce internal assessments of U.S. readiness against potential foes. Hegseth, who himself keeps a small group of advisers, was behind both decisions, defense officials told me.</p><p>Troops and civilians attend hundreds of events annually on behalf of the Pentagon, and have been doing so for decades. Whether gatherings on heady topics such as economic warfare and ‚Äúgray zone‚Äù tactics or highly technical symposia about combatting rust on ships and the future of drone warfare, these events keep the military plugged into ideas from scholars and industry. Particularly since the Iraq War, the military has said that it wants to seek out ways to challenge its assumptions and solicit outside views‚Äîto make officers think through their plans and strategies and the second- and third-order effects of their decisions. Conferences are some of the main venues for this kind of exchange, though not the only ones; officers from dozens of other nations sit alongside American counterparts at U.S. war colleges, for example.</p><p>Previous administrations have required military personnel to secure approval to attend conferences. The difference, this time, is the apparently partisan slant to the vetting process. By prohibiting DOD personnel from engaging with viewpoints that the administration disagrees with, defense officials and conference planners told me, the Pentagon risks groupthink that could have real consequences.</p><p>Pete Mansoor, a retired Army colonel who served as executive officer to General David Petraeus during the 2007 surge in Iraq, told me he believes that Hegseth‚Äôs emphasis on ‚Äúlethality‚Äù over the kind of strategic thinking often fostered at conferences and think tanks could prove dangerous. ‚ÄúThe fact that officers stopped thinking strategically and only thought about lethality resulted in a war that was almost lost in Iraq,‚Äù Mansoor, now a senior faculty fellow at Ohio State University‚Äôs Mershon Center for International Security Studies, said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the Russian army also stresses lethality,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúbut they have educated their generals on the basis of a million casualties‚Äù in Ukraine.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/trumps-cabinet-cosplay/682601/?utm_source=feed">Read: Trump‚Äôs cosplay Cabinet</a>]</i></p><p>If the department continues to ban conference attendance in a substantial way, it will also make U.S. forces more like their Russian and Chinese counterparts, which in many cases can seek outside views only through state-sanctioned academics. ‚ÄúWhen did our ideas become so fragile that they can‚Äôt stand up to someone who has alternate views?‚Äù one defense official asked me. (The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about this issue.)</p><p>The Defense Department review of conference attendance is having an immediate impact. Only after the policy was announced did Pentagon officials realize how many conferences military personnel attend, leading to a scramble to draft formal guidance across the force, defense officials told me. A DOD spokesperson was unable to tell me when such guidance will be released, and responded to a request for comment by pointing me to Parnell‚Äôs statement about the review. In the meantime, military personnel are preemptively canceling their attendance at conferences. Some inside the Pentagon have even canceled internal meetings, fearful of running afoul of the new ban on ‚Äúevents‚Äù and ‚Äúforums‚Äù not approved beforehand. National-security experts at think tanks, which often host security conferences, told me they are now unsure how much they can engage with American service members and the civilians working alongside them.</p><p>Also unclear is whether the policy applies to industry-related conferences, some of which are sponsored by private companies that spend millions of dollars to host them. Adding to the confusion, it was not initially clear whether the policy applied to one of the services, the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, not the DOD; a Coast Guard spokesperson told me that the service is working to align its policy with current DOD guidance.</p><p>Some military leaders dislike attending conferences and think-tank events, of course. Appearing in public forums can mean facing political questions and potentially giving a career-ending answer. Moreover, some leaders argue, think tanks are not always the best source of new ideas, particularly given that so many of their staff members once worked in government themselves. To tackle national-security threats, generals and admirals should be focused on warfare, not speaking to those who have never been on the front lines, the argument goes.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/07/pentagon-china-elbridge-colby/683677/?utm_source=feed">Read: The Pentagon‚Äôs policy guy is all in on China</a>]</i></p><p>But the U.S. military has had a symbiotic relationship with think tanks for years. While government employees and military officers are mired in day-to-day operations and focused on tactical warfare, outside scholars have the time and space for engaging in strategic thinking and coming up with solutions to thorny problems. Some think tanks have created positions for serving officers, and the Pentagon has also created internal positions for think tankers, in part to facilitate an exchange of ideas. ‚ÄúSo often in government, you are choosing between awful options. You think you have found the least-bad options, and places like think tanks allow you to test that conclusion,‚Äù Mara Karlin, a former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans, and capabilities, told me.</p><p>Several real policy changes have emerged from that arrangement. Scholars at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, produced a proposal that served as a blueprint for the 2007 surge in Iraq, at a time when the security situation in the country was deteriorating. A 2022 Center for Strategic and International Studies war-game <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/war-game-finds-u-s-taiwan-can-defend-against-a-chinese-invasion-11660047804?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiVl348zF-lv_JsS6xiIq_vrMXWV5FZ4KUgePJBGfWWx6kQxdanw9D-vZ2WAT8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=688b8384&amp;gaa_sig=NE9eFsd7QvdtCQ3a6kKch2V998HzinEOMKetnG9Rq491BPGXkEOc5F-dAw_RXWaEPQzLvcehcJIvYVH4OzWyNw%3D%3D">exercise</a> found that, in a hypothetical situation in which China invaded Taiwan, the United States would be in grave jeopardy in a matter of weeks‚Äîthe Chinese could successfully sink an aircraft carrier, attack U.S. bases in the region, and bring down American fighter jets. The exercise spurred Pentagon officials to reassess the military planning for a potential conflict in the region.</p><p>American officials have also made important statements and announcements at security-focused conferences. In the days before Russia‚Äôs 2022 invasion of Ukraine, then‚ÄìVice President Kamala Harris appeared at the Munich Security Conference to outline U.S. fears of imminent war. Earlier this year, Vice President J. D. Vance also attended the Munich Security Conference, where he blasted American allies and cast doubt on the idea that the United States would remain Europe‚Äôs security guarantor. This year, Hegseth himself appeared at the International Institute for Strategic Studies‚Äô Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore, where he outlined U.S. strategy to combat threats from China. (Breaking with long-standing military norms of nonpartisanship, Hegseth also spoke to young conservatives at Turning Point USA‚Äôs Student Action Summit last month.)</p><p>Later this year, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library &amp; Museum will host a major national-security conference that usually draws Cabinet secretaries, industry leaders, and America‚Äôs top generals and admirals. Several past defense secretaries have delivered the keynote speech. A phrase often invoked at the conference is <em>peace through strength</em>, which Reagan introduced into the modern lexicon during the 1980 presidential election, and which became a mantra of his administration‚Äôs defense policy. It has also become one of Hegseth‚Äôs favorite phrases for describing the military under Trump. And yet, by Hegseth‚Äôs own directive, no one knows whether he or the troops he urges to embrace that approach will be able to attend the conference that celebrates it.</p>
