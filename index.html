                        <div class="content"><p><i>This is an edition of </i>The Atlantic<i> Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. </i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/?utm_source=feed"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></p><p><i>Updated at 7.44 p.m. ET</i></p><p>President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth seem to be on a mission to erase women from the top ranks of the U.S. armed forces. Last week, they took another step along this path by removing the first female <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/07/21/hegseth-replaces-naval-academy-superintendent/">head</a> of the United States Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Maryland.</p><p>The Naval Academy was founded in 1845, but didn‚Äôt admit its first class of women until 1976. The head of the school is known as the superintendent, and Annapolis would not get its first female admiral in that position until 2024. Now the first woman to serve as the ‚Äúsupe‚Äù has been reassigned and replaced by a man, and for the first time in the academy‚Äôs history, the role went to a Marine. Last week, the Navy removed Vice Admiral <a href="https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/Search/Article/2236396/vice-admiral-yvette-davids/">Yvette Davids</a> from her post and replaced her with Lieutenant General <a href="https://www.manpower.marines.mil/About/Leaders/Biography/Article/3864243/deputy-commandant-manpower-and-reserve-affairs/">Michael Borgschulte</a>. (Maybe Hegseth thinks Marines are more <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/08/warrior-myth-lethality-pete-hegseth/683247/?utm_source=feed"><i>lethal</i></a>, to use his favorite Pentagon <a href="https://www.stevenhwilson.com/freedom-worship-word-will-not-speak/">worship word</a>.) Davids has been sent to the Pentagon, where she will be a deputy chief of naval operations, a senior‚Äîbut relatively invisible‚Äîposition.</p><p>No reason was given for reassigning Davids. Superintendents typically serve for three to five years, but Davids was pulled from the job after 18 months. (A short tenure can be a sign of some sort of problem; for what it‚Äôs worth, the secretary of the Navy, John Phelan‚Äîwho has never served in the Navy and has no background in national-defense issues‚Äîoffered rote <a href="https://news.usni.org/2025/07/17/marine-3-star-to-lead-naval-academy-davids-heading-to-opnav-staff">praise</a> when announcing her de facto firing as the supe.)</p><p>Trump and Hegseth have been on a firing spree throughout the military, especially when it comes to removing women from senior positions. This past winter, the administration fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first female chief of naval operations; Admiral Linda Fagan, the first female Coast Guard commandant; and Lieutenant General Jennifer Short, who was serving as the senior military assistant to the secretary of defense, all within weeks of one another. I taught for many years at the U.S. Naval War College, where I worked under its first female president, Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield. In 2023, she became the U.S. military representative to the NATO Military Committee‚Äîand then she was fired in April, apparently in part because of a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shoshana-chatfield-admiral-to-nato-fired-senior-military-officers-ousted/">presentation</a> she gave on Women‚Äôs Equality Day <i>10 years ago</i>.</p><p>At this point, women have been cleared out of all of the military‚Äôs top jobs. They are not likely to be replaced by other women: Of the three dozen four-star officers on active duty in the U.S. armed forces, none is female, and none of the administration‚Äôs pending appointments for senior jobs even at the three-star level is a woman.</p><p>Some observers might see a pattern here.</p><p>Discerning this pattern does not exactly require Columbo-level sleuthing. Hegseth‚Äôs antipathy toward women in the armed forces was well documented back in 2024 by none other than Hegseth himself. In his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-war-on-warriors-anon9780063389427/20719426?ean=9780063389427&amp;next=t"><i>The War on Warriors</i></a>, Hegseth decried what he believed was ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù by the American left: ‚ÄúWhile the American people had always rejected the radical-feminist so-called ‚ÄòEqual Rights Amendment,‚Äô Team Obama could fast-track their social engineering through the military‚Äôs top-down chain of command.‚Äù (This is probably why Hegseth also fired the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General C. Q. Brown, who is a Black man; Brown was let go for ostensibly being too interested in promoting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/21/trump-hegseth-joint-chiefs-cq-brown-jr">diversity</a> in the armed forces.)</p><p>Not that the secretary hates women, you should understand. Some of his best friends ‚Ä¶ well, as he put it in his book last year: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that individual women can‚Äôt be courageous, ambitious, and honorable. I know many phenomenal female soldiers. The problem is that the Left needs <i>every</i> woman to be as successful as every man, so they‚Äôve redefined success in a counterproductive way.‚Äù</p><p>I‚Äôm sure that the more than 225,000 American women who serve their country in uniform are relieved to know that they, too, can be courageous, and all that other great stuff. But Hegseth seems to be implying that many women in today‚Äôs military might have had their fitness reports massaged ‚Äúin a counterproductive way‚Äù to meet some sort of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù quota. And that, you see, is why the U.S. military‚Äôs most-senior female officers had to be removed: They were clearly part of some affirmative-action scheme. <i>Thank you for your service, ladies, but let‚Äôs remember that the Pentagon‚Äôs E-Ring is for the men</i>.</p><p>Oddly, Hegseth has no problem with ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù as long as it‚Äôs engineering something closer to 1955 than 2025. Indeed, he writes, the military ‚Äúhas always been about social engineering‚Äîforging young men (mostly) with skills, discipline, pride, and a brotherhood.‚Äù One might think that the goal is also to instill respect for one‚Äôs comrades, regardless of gender, and to defend the country and honor the Constitution, but Hegseth is more worried about what he fears is the distracting influence of women in the military. ‚ÄúMen and women are different,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúwith men being more aggressive.‚Äù (I read this in Cliff Clavin‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd6vzhwmup0">voice</a>: ‚ÄúYes, Diane ‚Ä¶ hold on to your hat, too, because the very letters <i>DNA</i> are an acronym for the words <i>Dames are Not Aggressive</i>.‚Äù) Hegseth goes on: ‚ÄúMen act differently toward women than they do other men. Men like women and are distracted by women. They also want to impress, and protect, women.‚Äù</p><p>In other words, after forging these neo-Spartans with some of the finest training from the most powerful military the world has ever known, Americans still must worry that these carbon-steel warriors, ready to do battle with any number of global menaces, might have their ‚Äúlethality‚Äù sabotaged by the fluttering eyelashes and shapely gams of their sisters in arms.</p><p>I was teaching senior officers, male and female, from all branches of the armed forces when Hegseth was <a href="https://x.com/CitizenScreen/status/1946417295825264828">still</a> in high school. His view of women in the U.S. military would be beneath serious comment were he not, through the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/01/the-hegseth-hearing-was-a-national-embarrassment/681315/?utm_source=feed">malpractice</a> of the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, the sitting secretary of defense. Instead of defending the nation‚Äîor keeping track of the security of his own <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/06/signalgate-trump-atlantic-interview/682576/?utm_source=feed">communications</a>‚Äîhe is trying to make the American military inhospitable to half of the nation‚Äôs population.</p><p>As Nora Bensahel, a scholar of civil-military relations at Johns Hopkins University, told me, the firing of Davids and other women ‚Äúis deliberately sending a chilling message to the women who are already serving in uniform, and to girls who may be thinking about doing so, that they are not welcome‚Äîeven though the military would not be able to meet its recruiting numbers without those very same women.‚Äù</p><p>Today is my late mother‚Äôs birthday. She enlisted in the Air Force and served during the Korean War. She came from a poor family, and had to leave the military when her father was dying. But she was deeply proud of her service in America‚Äôs armed forces; I remember watching her march in uniform in hometown parades. She would be heartbroken‚Äîand furious‚Äîto know that more than a half century after her service, the message to the women of the United States from the current commander in chief and his secretary of defense amounts to a sexist warning: <i>Feel free to join the military and serve your country‚Äîbut know your place</i>.</p><p><b>Related: </b></p><ul>

<p>Chasing le Carr√© in Corfu</p><p><i>By Honor Jones</i></p><blockquote>
<p>Black dress, pink coat, thick beige stockings. This is the third time I‚Äôve seen her. She walks down the middle of the street outside my window, her head bent forward under its helmet of grandmother hair. She carries her handbag like a briefcase with a bomb in it. She has the look of someone whose friends are all dead.</p>

<p>I saw her first outside Saint Spyridon Church, lighting a candle. And then again in Spianada Square, among the scootering children. I lean out the window to watch her disappear around the corner. Maybe there‚Äôs nothing suspicious about it. Corfu is a small city, on a small island in Greece. From my hotel room I can see the green edge of the cricket pitch where, in John le Carr√©‚Äôs <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780143119760"><i>A Perfect Spy</i></a>, the Czech agent, Axel, chased Magnus Pym in slow, limping circles.</p>

<p>I hope that readers of the Daily won‚Äôt mind a personal reminiscence. My mother used to tell me, when I was a boy in the 1960s, that if any other kid used the old insult ‚ÄúYour mother wears Army boots,‚Äù I should always correct them: ‚Äú<i>Air Force</i> boots.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a picture of my mother, barely an adult, in her uniform. She joined alongside her sister, and both of them went to basic training in Texas‚Äîat that time, the farthest from home my mother had ever been. She later was assigned to do office work at an Air Force base in Massachusetts. Like other poor kids from rough backgrounds, she found order and a home, however briefly, in the military, and was proud of her service ‚Äôtil the end of her life.</p><p>‚Äî Tom</p>

                        <div class="content"><p>Summer weekends in America are good for lots of things: baseball games, cookouts, farmers‚Äô markets, sipping a bev next to a lake. Or, if you‚Äôre President Donald Trump: crashing out on social media in hopes of distracting the nation from nonstop coverage of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/19/us/politics/inside-trump-epstein-friendship.html">long friendship</a> with Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p></p><p>Trump is an inveterate poster, known for his erratic style and late-night tirades. But over the weekend, as the world refused to move on from his administration‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/epstein-files-trump/683503/?utm_source=feed">bizarre handling of the Epstein files</a>‚Äîwhich has led segments of his base to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/trump-epstein-late-stage-conspiracism/683570/?utm_source=feed">completely melt down</a>‚ÄîTrump went on a posting spree that was alarming, even by his own standards.</p><p></p><p>On Sunday alone, Trump posted 33 times on Truth Social, sending off 20 posts between 6:46 and 8:53 p.m. eastern. He demanded that the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians revert to their original names (the Redskins and Indians, respectively), and posted an AI-generated video of Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office set to the song ‚ÄúY.M.C.A.,‚Äù by the Village People. Trump also shared a contextless, grainy video that looks like it was scraped from some viral social-media post. It includes no captions and features <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114887999995033128">25 stitched-together clips</a>, set to music, of people doing wild or dangerous stunts: A woman appears to catch a charging cobra with her bare hands, a man does a forward flip from one moving skateboard to another, various people contort their bodies in strange ways, a dude stands on the footrests of a moving dirt bike.</p><p></p><p>Even some of Trump‚Äôs die-hard fans on Truth Social seemed caught off guard by the video, struggling to draw a connection between it and Trump‚Äôs politics. ‚ÄúWas expecting a video of you at the end!‚Äù one top commenter <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@CarmelRae/114888397557947849">wrote</a>. (A spokesperson for the White House did not answer my questions about why the commander in chief was posting an extreme-sports highlight reel on Sunday night.)</p><p></p><p>The bizarre video was immediately recognizable to me as the type of garbage that clogs the feeds of many people who still use Facebook, a platform that is filled with inscrutable slop posted by spammers and content farmers. By the early 2020s‚Äîbefore generative-AI images <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/06/hot-jesus-ai/678814/?utm_source=feed">took over</a>‚ÄîFacebook had already transformed into a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/11/facebooks-vast-wasteland/676883/?utm_source=feed">vast wasteland</a> of low-quality memes, repurposed videos, and strange pages dedicated to clips like ‚ÄúShelter Pit Bull Made His Bed Every Day Until a Family Adopted Him.‚Äù This type of content fits in a category that I have taken to calling ‚Äúsoft-brain scrolling.‚Äù It falls somewhere between probably harmless and not nutritious; it‚Äôs mostly low-quality algorithmic arbitrage that <a href="https://www.404media.co/facebooks-algorithm-is-boosting-ai-spam-that-links-to-ai-generated-ad-laden-click-farms/">helps click farmers make a buck</a>. Your confused relatives seem to love it.</p><p></p><p>That the account belonging to the president of the United States is now posting to the entire world like a Facebook Uncle, though, is a troubling sign. (It‚Äôs unclear if Trump does all of the direct publishing himself, though <em>The Washington Post </em>reported last month that aides have been surprised by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/06/03/trump-truth-social-twitter/">messages posted to his account</a> in the wee hours of the morning. In the past, he would <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68987594">reportedly dictate and edit his own tweets</a>, down to the odd capitalization of specific words.) He‚Äôs exhibited milder forms of Facebook Uncle syndrome for years now‚Äîeven in 2016, Trump would <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/01/donald-trump-mostly-retweets-white-supremacists.html">retweet</a> white-supremacist accounts, <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/805278955150471168">angrily</a> live-tweet <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and publicly <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/813945096269860866">congratulate</a> himself‚Äîbut the behavior appears to be getting worse.</p><p></p><p>The best analogue for this moment may be Trump‚Äôs online raging after the January 6, 2021, insurrection. During this period, Trump was temporarily banned from mainstream platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. He launched Truth Social in 2022 and began making and sharing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/us/politics/trump-social-media-extremism.html">more extreme posts</a>, including hundreds from accounts promoting QAnon conspiracy theories. In one day in 2022, he reportedly posted 50 separate times‚Äîin many cases about how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen. The tone this past weekend felt similar, with Trump posting an AI-generated image of officials from the Obama administration and former FBI Director James Comey in orange prison jumpsuits, arrayed in a <em>Brady Bunch‚Äì</em>style grid. The center of the image <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114888263063561606">reads</a> ‚ÄúThe Shady Bunch.‚Äù Along the same lines, Trump also posted a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114863203348237352">caps-laden message to his followers last week</a>, demanding that they move on from the Epstein ‚ÄúHoax‚Äù and calling it ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù from the ‚ÄúLunatic Left.‚Äù He is lashing out, on the defensive, and seemingly unable, or at best unwilling, to control his screen time.</p><p></p><p>Trump has always loved to post, obviously, and even the generative-AI stuff isn‚Äôt new, exactly. Last year, during his presidential campaign, Trump fully embraced<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/trump-posts-ai-image/679540/?utm_source=feed"> the technology as a propaganda tool</a>, posting and reposting images of himself praying, Taylor Swift fans endorsing him en masse (that was before the real Taylor Swift endorsed his opponent), and AI Kamala Harris speaking in front of a hammer and sickle flag. As the <em>Post </em>reported in its article about Trump‚Äôs social-media use, in the first four and a half months of this term, Trump ‚Äúposted to Truth Social over 2,200 times‚Äîmore than three times the number of tweets he sent in the same period in 2017.‚Äù</p><p></p><p>Unlike the material we saw over the weekend, a lot of Trump‚Äôs posts during that period were clear political statements and directives. During Trump‚Äôs tariff vacillations, which caused markets to plummet, he posted on Truth Social that Americans should ‚ÄúBE COOL‚Äù and not become ‚ÄúPANICANS,‚Äù an invented term for people who expressed genuine concern that Trump was destroying the economy. (MAGA influencers tried and failed to make that one stick.) Trump also used his account to threaten world leaders. For instance, he lashed out at Colombian President Gustavo Petro over his attempts to block deportation flights. (Petro<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p36e62gyo"> backed down</a>.) In May, he used the account to admonish Russian President Vladimir Putin,<a href="https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/31265"> suggesting</a> that ‚Äúif it weren‚Äôt for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia,‚Äù and that Putin was ‚Äúplaying with fire!‚Äù His posting in the lead-up to bombing Iran was another example of Trump forcing the world to hang on his every word; eventually, he announced the strike via Truth Social. In all cases, Trump was posting, however maniacally, from a position of power and demonstrating influence.</p><p></p><p>Not so recently. The week that preceded the Truth Social binge on Sunday may very well have been the most frustrating of Trump‚Äôs second term, not only because the Epstein scandal threatened to tear apart his MAGA coalition, but because Trump could not persuade the usual people to drop the story. As my colleagues Ashley Parker and Jonathan Lemire<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/inside-white-house-trump-epstein-strategy/683604/?utm_source=feed"> reported over the weekend</a>, ‚Äúthe limits of his power over normal allies became evident‚Äù as Trump failed to get Rupert Murdoch or <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em>‚Äôs editor in chief, Emma Tucker, to stop the paper from publishing a story about a<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796"> lewd 50th-birthday letter</a> that Trump allegedly sent to Epstein.</p><p></p><p>Trump had to deal with frustrations like these during his first term, when he was often checked and handled by career politicians and beset by press leaks from anonymous staffers, and faced constant backlash from the media and Silicon Valley. But Trump‚Äôs second term has been different. He‚Äôs surrounded mostly by true believers and sycophants and able to engage somewhat freely in<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/american-panopticon/682616/?utm_source=feed"> various forms of government dismantling and corruption</a>. Numerous media companies have<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5454790/cbs-settlement-trump-60-minutes-harris-interview-analysis"> bowed</a> to Trump or appeared to<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y44gw5gpro"> soften</a> their adversarial stance. At Trump‚Äôs inauguration,<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/trump-musk-zuckerberg-silicon-valley-kisses-the-ring/681384/?utm_source=feed"> Silicon Valley‚Äôs most powerful executives stood behind him</a>, offering a tacit show of support for his administration. The vibe had shifted in Trump‚Äôs favor, and he behaved with impunity. Yet the Epstein case has been a genuine hurdle. Republicans are seemingly desperate to make the story go away, so much so that Speaker Mike Johnson<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/22/us/trump-news?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=bsky-nytimes"> shut the House down</a> early to avoid ‚Äúpolitical games‚Äù and block any potential votes calling for the release of files pertaining to Epstein.</p><p></p><p>One can tell a lot about how Trump feels about his own power and influence by the way he‚Äôs posting. There are multiple ways to interpret Trump‚Äôs weekend posts. The most basic is that Trump‚Äôs long-standing obsession with AI slop and memes‚Äîworking in overdrive right now‚Äîis a useful propaganda tool. Before he needed a grassroots meme army to provide memes; now polished and bespoke Trump slop is always just a ChatGPT query away, no genuine enthusiasm required.</p><p></p><p>A second reading is to see Trump‚Äôs affinity for reposting fan art as Executive Cope. Here, the slop is a way for Trump to escape and imagine the world as he‚Äôd like it to be. In slop world, Trump is not embattled, getting screamed at by his supporters over what looks to them like a guilty cover-up on behalf of a pedophile. Instead, he‚Äôs arresting Obama. It‚Äôs pure fan fiction that depicts Trump having power in a moment when, perhaps, he feels somewhat powerless.</p><p></p><p>A third reading of Trump‚Äôs Truth Social posts‚Äîespecially his reposting of strange viral Facebook garbage and angry culture-war stuff railing against ‚Äúwoke‚Äù sports-team names‚Äîsuggests that these posts aren‚Äôt part of any kind of strategy or coping mechanism, but examples of a person who is addled and raging at things he feels he has no control over. For years, people have offered anecdotes that Trump behaves online like some isolated, elderly people who have been radicalized by their social-media feeds‚Äîin 2017, Stephen Colbert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVGsb5kjXlQ">memorably</a> likened Trump to America‚Äôs first racist grandpa. His recent posting certainly fits this template. And paired with some of Trump‚Äôs other cognitive stumbles‚Äî<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-was-surprised-jerome-powell-fed-chair-appointed-was-appoint-rcna219162">he seemingly forgot last week that he had appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell</a>‚Äîit all starts to feel more concerning.</p><p></p><p>In this context, Trump‚Äôs Truth Social page is little more than a rapid-response account that illustrates a world that doesn‚Äôt actually exist: one in which POTUS looks like a comic-book hero, is universally beloved, and exerts his executive authority to jail or silence anyone who disagrees with him. This sort of revenge fantasy would be sad coming from anyone. That it is coming from the president of the United States, a man obsessed with retribution, who presides over a government that is enthusiastically arresting and jailing immigrants in makeshift camps, is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>All of this points to what my colleague Tom Nichols <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/07/a-searing-reminder-that-trump-is-unwell/679170/?utm_source=feed">noted</a> almost exactly one year ago, when Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination: The president ‚Äúis emotionally unwell.‚Äù In describing Trump‚Äôs speech that night, Nichols said that his long, often pointless digressions ‚Äúwere the ramblings of a man who has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/?utm_source=feed">serious psychological problems</a>. All of it was on display last night: rage, paranoia, pettiness, desolating selfishness.‚Äù</p><p></p><p>The same explanation could be applied perfectly to Trump‚Äôs Truth Social posts over the weekend. Trump called for Senator Adam Schiff to be prosecuted. He appeared pathologically aggrieved‚Äîspending part of his Saturday night <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/retconning--russiagate">posting</a> a detailed infographic intended to debunk the supposed ‚ÄúRussia hoax‚Äù from an election that happened almost nine years ago. (Propaganda experts <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/retconning--russiagate">say</a> this is an attempt by Trump and his administration to rewrite history.) He posted a fake mug shot of Obama. And, on Sunday morning, he pecked out a 103-word <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114885422115933668">message</a> congratulating himself on his first six months in office. Rage, paranoia, pettiness, and desolating selfishness: Trump appears consumed more and more by an online world that offers him the chance to live out the fantasy of the unilateral power and adulation that he craves.</p><p></p><p>Talking about Trump and social media is complicated because, unlike most users, Trump <em>can</em> post ridiculous things, transform news cycles, and force the world to react to his posts. But lately, his posts are not having the desired effect. It‚Äôs possible that what observers witnessed this weekend is a tipping point of sorts. Trump‚Äôs posts, instead of influencing reality, suggest that the president is retreating from it entirely.</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p>Every so often, Donald Trump sends an encouraging signal to Ukraine, despite his long pattern of deference toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last week, the president of the United States allowed the transfer of a number of American Patriot anti-missile systems through Germany‚Äîa move that will strengthen Ukraine‚Äôs air defense at a dangerous time. The Ukrainians are so pleased with this offer that President Volodymyr Zelensky <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/17/us-news/trump-zelensky-discuss-drone-mega-deal-for-us-to-buy-battle-ready-ukraine-uavs/">has floated</a> an expanded military relationship, wherein Ukraine would share its drone expertise with Americans in exchange for further arms sales.</p><p>Then again, Ukrainian air defenses are overstretched in part because of another recent decision Trump made: As he was agreeing last week to allow the transfer of more Patriots to Ukraine‚Äîat Europe‚Äôs expense‚Äîhe also gave Putin about 50 days to come to the negotiating table before the White House will consider new sanctions against Russia. In essence, Trump gave the Russian dictator the rest of the summer to continue his bombing campaign against Ukrainian cities.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/06/ukraine-new-war-drone-strike/683008/?utm_source=feed">Phillips Payson O‚ÄôBrien: Ukraine‚Äôs warning to the world‚Äôs other military forces</a>]</i></p><p>Recognizing that supporting a democratic Ukraine against Putin‚Äôs invasion is in America‚Äôs interest, the Biden administration had donated weapons to Ukraine, rather than expecting to be paid for them. Ukraine, which needs supplies to continue its fight, has no real choice but to keep seeking the White House‚Äôs favor. But Trump seems to be stringing the Ukrainians along. The equipment he plans to furnish will not be enough to enable the Ukrainians to win. Whatever help he provides appears less decisive than the obstacles he puts in their way.</p><p>For months now, the Russians have spurned any real negotiations with Ukraine and ramped up their bombardment of Ukrainian cities‚Äîkilling and maiming civilians on almost a nightly basis. In response to this, Trump has regularly decried Putin‚Äôs actions, but resolutely refused to take any concrete steps himself to rein the Russian dictator in.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/thomas-wright/?utm_source=feed">Thomas Wright</a>]</i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/trump-ukraine-policy-putin-battlefield/683535/?utm_source=feed">: Putin needs to believe he can‚Äôt win</a></p><p>As Russia launched an ever-larger number of missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, many in Congress were eager to approve crippling secondary sanctions that would have all but prevented outside powers from doing business with Russia. These measures were included in a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal‚Äîand co-sponsored by more than 80 other members of the senior chamber. It was also a bill that stood to gain quick passage in the House‚Äîif Trump would allow House Speaker Mike Johnson bring it to a vote. Trump even indicated that his wife, Melania, was appalled at the destruction that Ukrainians keep suffering. ‚ÄúI go home. I tell the first lady, ‚ÄòYou know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.‚Äô She said, ‚ÄòOh, really? Another city was just hit,‚Äô‚Äù Trump said last week.</p><p>But instead of moving firmly against Putin, Trump gave his 50-day ultimatum‚Äîwhich may not even be an ultimatum if, in the end, Trump backs off his threat to impose ‚Äúvery severe tariffs‚Äù on Russia. As nationalist commentators in Russia quickly understood, Trump was offering Putin a great strategic gift. In part because Trump has refused to add new sanctions after his inauguration in January, and suppliers have found ways around existing ones, Russia can now manufacture more missiles. After dark, Russian forces are bombarding Ukrainian cities with a growing number of missiles and drones‚Äîthe <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-putin-attacks-0a06736dea37114aa0f351d21746912b">record for one night</a>, set earlier this month, is more than 700, a quantity that would have been inconceivable in 2022, at the start of the full-scale invasion. And German General Christian Freuding, head of the Ukraine Situational Center at the German Ministry of Defense, recently said that Russia <a href="https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/germany-warns-russia-could-unleash-2-000-1752987508.html">wants to be able to launch 2,000 drones</a> in a single attack.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/nataliya-gumenyuk/?utm_source=feed">Nataliya Gumenyuk</a>]</i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/05/ukraine-troops-front-lines/682910/?utm_source=feed">: Ukraine‚Äôs new way of war</a></p><p>Even if Ukraine gains access to greater defensive firepower, the country almost certainly won‚Äôt be able to shoot down all of the incoming munitions in attacks of that size, and the toll in Ukrainian lives seems sure to mount.</p><p>On the ground, Russia can step up its efforts to take one tiny parcel of Ukrainian land after the next‚Äîeven at the cost of sending tens of thousands more of its own soldiers to their doom. If Trump genuinely has plans to increase pressure on Russia after his 50-day grace period expires, he‚Äôs essentially giving Putin reason to set a goal of conquering as much territory as possible before coming to any peace talks.</p><p>At the end of a 50-day rampage, the Russians could even decide to take up the terrible ‚Äúpeace‚Äù deal that the Trump administration floated a few months ago. This included letting the Russians keep almost every piece of Ukrainian land they have seized, granting U.S. recognition of Russian control over Crimea, depriving Ukraine of any hope of NATO membership, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas">withholding any meaningful security guarantees</a> whatsoever.</p><p>Having done everything Trump has asked, having negotiated in good faith, having kissed up to the president, having avoided attacking Russian civilian targets partially out of deference to the U.S., the Ukrainians now see the White House basically guaranteeing the Russians a sanctions-free summer to commit any atrocities they want.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Zelensky‚Äôs offer to share drone expertise is a gamble, given Trump‚Äôs apparent sympathy for Putin. Hoping to entice his American counterpart into providing reliable support, the Ukrainian leader previously offered the United States an interest in his country‚Äôs mineral wealth. The deal is in effect, but Trump‚Äôs support remains fickle at best, because supporting a free people in their struggle against a foreign dictatorship is no longer a priority for the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Dear James,</strong></p><p>I‚Äôve been a lifelong participant in various recreational sports. Candidly, I‚Äôm not a great athlete, but I‚Äôve always been enthusiastic. Now, in my late 50s, I‚Äôve gotten especially serious about tennis. Sometimes, I play five times a week. I‚Äôve committed to improving and have taken group and individual lessons. I play in competitive United States Tennis Association leagues specific to my age and ability, and play pickup games whenever I can.</p><p>But I realize that when I play competitively, I have a negative, lingering, outsize reaction to losing. When I lose, I try to reframe it less as a defeat and more as <em>What did I learn today?</em> Yet my mind leads me back to despair and rumination on my mistakes.</p><p>Logically, I know that if I were to win these competitions, I would most likely be bumped up to the next level. And at that point, I would probably be the weakest player in a higher level of competition‚Äîleading right back, with even more frequency, to despair. Some athletes joyfully stick with their sports for a lifetime and don‚Äôt seem to be derailed by losing. What am I missing? How can I develop a healthier relationship to defeat?</p>
<p><strong>Dear Reader,</strong></p><p>I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre missing anything. We all lose in the end‚Äîthat‚Äôs the second law of thermodynamics. And every intervening loss, be it in business, love, or tennis, simply reminds us of this elemental fact. Is it even possible to have a healthy relationship with losing? I‚Äôm not sure it is, any more than it‚Äôs possible to have a healthy relationship with food poisoning. Certain human experiences simply resist philosophy.</p><p>My grandfather, who had an ego like a piece of Roman statuary, enjoyed a game of chess. Especially in his final years: late-night, booze-fueled and booze-fuddled, with the occasional, accidental knocking-over of pieces. He enjoyed it‚Äîif he won. If he didn‚Äôt win, he would take it as a melancholy comment on his old age, as evidence that his mind was going at last. And then he would slump, and brood loudly upon his failing faculties. So, as his opponent, you had to lose. But you couldn‚Äôt lose too easily or obviously; fuzzy as he was, he would pick up on that. You had to lose while looking as if you were trying to win. (It often fell to my brother, a teenager at the time and‚Äîluckily for my grandfather‚Äîan excellent chess player, to perform this complex operation.)</p><p>What‚Äôs my point? Good question. I think my point is that losing is never just losing. In your case, losing at tennis connects to what? An ever-present and not particularly welcome sense of your limitations as a player? A whisper of advancing decrepitude? Some other, deeper, darker thing? When I lose, I feel like the cosmos is against me. And I‚Äôm right.</p><p>So forget about being a good loser. Work on the comeback: That‚Äôs my advice. Doomed as we may be to entropy, we humans also possess nearly idiotic capacities for self-renewal. We bounce back! Soak up the gall of losing, absorb the horrible information, feel it to the full, go there‚Äîand then rebound, with superb elasticity. Save your energy for that.</p><p>Anticipating a National Magazine Award for this column,</p><p>James</p>

This joke is funny, because people are constantly saying that Gutfeld is a Nazi, and he is getting a little sick of it. So, to dodge the Nazi allegations, he‚Äôs riffing on the N-word! This is comedy now!</p><p>Comedy is legal again. You are free to say whatever you want, provided it‚Äôs a slur. You must say it, or President Trump won‚Äôt approve your <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-washington-commanders-change-back-to-former-name/">new stadium</a>! No, that‚Äôs not a joke. That‚Äôs completely serious.</p><p>You should know by now: Everything is serious, until it‚Äôs suddenly a joke and you were a fool for not laughing. Everything is a joke, until suddenly it‚Äôs serious and <i>how dare you laugh</i>. Everyone is trolling, until they aren‚Äôt, and even when they aren‚Äôt, they are. Everyone is always and never joking. It‚Äôs not a threat. It‚Äôs a joke. Comedy is legal again!</p>
<p>Tragedy, to paraphrase Mel Brooks, is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die. More and more people are getting pushed into open sewers lately. Boom times for comedy. Boom times for laughing <i>at</i>. From the open sewer, you can hear a lot of laughing.</p><p>They are so glad not to have to remember anymore that other people are in the room. What an enormous relief! Finally, they can <i>say </i>it! That is the project of Trumpism: becoming the only people in the room again. Becoming both the protagonists and the intended audience, the only people whose laughter counts.</p><p>What you think is funny depends on what you believe to be true. When you make a joke, you are asking someone to look at something and see the same thing you see. When the response is laughter, it is a way of making eye contact, of looking through the world at one another. That is the terror of bombing onstage: the realization that what you are seeing is not what everyone else is seeing. The anxiety that you have got the world by the wrong end, that you are alone in what you think.</p><p>But there are two reasons you can laugh. One is recognition, and the other is coercion. Some jokes are funny only with a power differential to back them up. This is the kind of comedy that‚Äôs legal now: the joke whose punch line you‚Äôre afraid to be. The kind of joke you have to take. Laugh, so they‚Äôll know you‚Äôre one of them. Laugh, or he‚Äôll kill you. Laugh, and maybe you won‚Äôt be next.</p></div>
