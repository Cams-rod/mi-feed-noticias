<p>I recently asked readers to share a photo of something that sparked their sense of awe in the world. “I had awakened early on this morning in July 2016 and tiptoed out of the hikers' dorms at Rifugio Lagazuoi, which is perched at 9,000 feet in the Italian Dolomites,” Tim Tumlin, 74, in Darien, Illinois, writes. “As I hoped, the silent overwhelming beauty made the climb the day before more than worthwhile.”</p><p>I’ll continue to feature your responses in the coming weeks.</p><p>— Isabel</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p>Can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ah9tWTkmk"><em>this</em></a> really be the song of the summer? For seven weeks now, the most popular tune in the country has been Alex Warren’s “Ordinary”—a solemn ballad that has all of the warm-weather appropriateness of a fur coat. Ideally, the song of the summer is a buoyant one, giving you a beat to bob a flamingo floatie to. “Ordinary,” instead, is made for stomping, moping, and forgetting.</p><p>The top reaches of the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 have otherwise mostly been stale and flukey, filled with songs that were popular <em>last</em> summer (Teddy Swims’s “Lose Control”), replacement-level efforts by the streaming behemoths Drake and Morgan Wallen, and tie-ins from the Netflix cartoon show <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. Then, just last week, a welcome bit of warmth and novelty emerged at No. 2—“Daisies” by Justin Bieber, the unlikely emblem of our obviously fragile national mood.</p><p>Perhaps you aren’t inclined to check out new music by a formerly chirpy child star who lately has been best known for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/style/justin-bieber-paparazzi.html">surreal interactions with paparazzi</a>. But earlier this month, the 31-year-old Bieber suddenly released a new album, <em>Swag</em>, that made headlines for being rather good. Not “good for Bieber”; good for a modern pop release. <em>Swag</em> filled a void in the summer-listening landscape by meeting listeners where they so clearly seem to be—less in need of a party-fueling energy drink than a soothing slather of aloe.</p><p>The album is Bieber’s first since parting ways with manager <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-oddly-nasty-fight-over-recording-rights/593113/?utm_source=feed">Scooter Braun, the record-business kingpin</a> who recently seemed to suffer a catastrophic <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/ariana-grande-demi-lovato-scooter-braun-manager-split.html#:~:text=Justin%20Bieber%2C%20Ariana%20Grande%2C%20Demi,as%20CEO%20of%20HYBE%20America.">collapse in support</a> from the celebrity class. The music departs from the pert poppiness of Bieber’s past to indulge the singer’s well-documented fascination with hip-hop and R&amp;B. In one interlude, the comedian Druski tells Bieber “your soul is Black”; the assertion is cringey, but the album’s music is significantly more subtle than that. Bieber never really raps. Rather, he uses his ever-yearning, creamy-soft voice to do what great rappers and R&amp;B singers often do: find a pocket within a beat, and then let emotions be his guide.</p><p>What’s really fascinating about the album, though, is that it sounds like it’s wrapped in gauze. The production is aqueous and rippling, rather than shiny and laminated as one might expect from Bieber. <em>Swag</em> is heavily influenced by the indie producer-artists Dijon (who collaborated on a few of the album’s songs) and Mk.gee (a producer on “Daisies”). They have risen to prominence by swirling bygone rock and pop signifiers into a comforting yet complex stew of sound. <em>Swag</em>’s songs similarly hit the listener with a sense of gentle intrigue, like a minor recovered memory.</p><div class="oembed"></div><p>The instant hit “Daisies” exemplifies the approach. Its twanging guitars and pounding drums scan as countrified classic rock, but every element seems muffled, as if emanating from an iPhone lost in a couch. The verses steadily build energy and excitement—but then disperse in a gentle puff of feeling. In a lullaby whisper, Bieber sings of pining for his girl and sticking with her through good times and bad. “Hold on, hold on,” goes one refrain: a statement of desire for safety and stability, not passion and heat.</p><p>But my personal song-of-the-summer nomination would be <em>Swag</em>’s opening track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogVL5Hdh8Po">“All I Can Take.”</a> It opens in a tenor of pure cheese, with keyboard tones that were last fashionable when Steve Winwood and Boyz II Men were soundtracking school dances. A lightly pumping beat comes to the fore, setting the stage for a parade of different-sounding Biebers to perform. In one moment, he’s a panting Michael Jackson impersonator. In another, he’s an electronically distorted hyperpop sprite. The song is serene, and pretty, and ever so sad—yet it’s also wiggling with details that suggest there’s more to the story than initially meets the ear. The lyrics thread together sex talk with hints of stresses that must be escaped; “It’s all I can take in this moment,” Bieber sings, hinting at a burnout whose cause the listener is left to imagine.</p>
<p><em>Swag</em>’s approach—downtempo yet bustling, melancholic yet awake—is on trend emotionally as much as it is musically. Though the year has brought no shortage of bright, upbeat pop albums from the likes of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/03/lady-gaga-mayhem-review/681991/?utm_source=feed">Lady Gaga</a> and Kesha, the music that’s sticking around has a reserved, simmering quality. The biggest Wallen song of the moment is “What I Want,” a collaboration with the whisper-singing diva Tate McRae; it builds suspense for a full minute before any percussion enters. One rising hit, Ravyn Lenae’s “Love Me Not,” has a neo-soul arrangement that fidgets enough to keep the ear occupied without demanding active attention.</p><p>A dreary technological reason probably explains why this kind of music is popular: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/02/mood-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-review/681636/?utm_source=feed">Streaming rewards background fare</a> more than it rewards jolting dynamism. But even looking at my own recent playlists, downtempo seems in. The best song by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/miley-cyrus-addison-rae-new-albums-review/683134/?utm_source=feed">Addison Rae</a>, the TikTok phenom turned pop mastermind, is “Headphones On,” a chill-out track laden with tolling bells and jazz keyboards. I have kept returning to the album <em>Choke Enough</em> by Oklou, a French singer who makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STP4cCpyScE">electronic pop</a> that’s so skeletal and frail-seeming, you worry you’re despoiling the songs merely by listening to them. Other recent highlights: the mumbled and dreamy indie rock of Alex G’s <em>Headlights</em>, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/haim-i-quit-millennial-breakup-album-review/683240/?utm_source=feed">depressive easy listening of Haim’s <em>I quit</em></a>, and “Shapeshifter,” the wintry-sounding standout from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/lorde-virgin-review/683345/?utm_source=feed">Lorde’s <em>Virgin</em></a>.</p><p>It’s hard to avoid psychoanalyzing this season’s musical offerings and concluding that the culture is suffering from malaise, or at least a hangover. After all, just a year ago we had<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/06/charli-xcx-sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-summer-pop/678760/?utm_source=feed"> “<em>Brat</em> summer,”</a> named for the hedonistic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/12/best-albums-2024-mount-eerie-charli-xcx-kim-gordon/680852/?utm_source=feed">Charli XCX album</a>. The songs of that summer were <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/09/the-dare-whats-wrong-with-new-york-review/679699/?utm_source=feed">irrepressible</a>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/08/sabrina-carpenter-short-n-sweet-review/679638/?utm_source=feed">Sabrina Carpenter’s sarcastic “Espresso,”</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/05/kendrick-lamar-drake-beef/678327/?utm_source=feed">Kendrick Lamar’s taunting “Not Like Us,”</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/06/hip-hop-country-billboard-charts-shaboozey/678652/?utm_source=feed">Shaboozey’s thumping “A Bar Song (Tipsy).”</a> But this year, Charli XCX’s biggest song is “Party 4 U”—a pandemic-doldrums ballad released in 2020 that recently blew up thanks to a TikTok trend of people sharing emo stories about their lives. The track captures a bleary feeling of trying to have fun but getting pulled into melancholy.</p><p>That’s a feeling lots of Americans surely can relate to. Every era brings its own reasons to fret about the state of the world, but the headline-news topics of late—wars, deportations, layoffs—are upending lives in profound ways at mass scale. <em>Swag</em> isn’t about any of that, but great pop always works to make small and personal emotions echo broad, communal ones.</p><p>Bieber’s highly publicized experiences <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/09/justin-biebers-drug-recovery-message-youre-not-alone/597355/?utm_source=feed">navigating mental health, drug use, and physical maladies</a> have long served up a cautionary tale about life in the internet era. In the months leading up to <em>Swag</em>’s release, he posted angry, inscrutable messages online and confronted reporters on the streets. Pundits have taken to asking <em>Is he okay?</em> The cooling, noncommittal, lightly distressed sound of <em>Swag </em>is an answer of sorts. Like many of us, he’s doing as well as can be, given the circumstances.</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p>Americans have a long history of enduring heat waves by going outside. In a 1998 essay for <em>The New Yorker</em>, the author Arthur Miller described urbanites’ Depression-era coping mechanisms: People caught the breeze on open-air trolleys, climbed onto the back of ice trucks, and flocked to the beach. In the evenings, they slept in parks or dragged their mattresses onto fire escapes.</p><p>But since air conditioning <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-air-conditioning">went mainstream</a>, in the 1960s, the easiest way to beat the heat has been by staying indoors—at home, the office, the mall—where cool air is a constant and blinds are often drawn to prevent homes from overheating (and electric bills from skyrocketing). For this convenience, Americans sacrifice the benefits of sunshine and the opportunities for fun it creates. As climate change turns up the temperature, summers in America are coming down to a choice between enduring the heat and avoiding it—both of which might, in their own ways, be making people sick.</p><p>In cities across the country, summers are, on average, <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/2025-summer-package">2.6 degrees hotter</a> than they were some 50 years ago. In Phoenix, where a 95-degree day is a relief, schedules are arranged around the darkness; Jeffrey Gibson, an accountant who works from home, takes his eight-month-old daughter out for walks before 6:30 a.m.; after that, it’s so hot that she flushes bright red if they venture outside. He spends the rest of his day indoors unless leaving is absolutely necessary. It’s like this from April to October. Gibson recently told his wife, “Man, I think I’m a little depressed.”</p><p>Josef A. Von Isser, a therapist in Tucson, Arizona, told me that feeling low in the summer comes up a lot with his clients. Some feel that the heat affects them directly; others struggle with its indirect effects, such as fewer opportunities to socialize and be somewhere other than home or the office. All of them, he suspects, might be experiencing seasonal affective disorder.</p><p>The <em>DSM-5</em> categorizes SAD as a type of<a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/seasonal-affective-disorder"> major depression with a seasonal pattern</a>, with symptoms such as sadness, feelings of worthlessness, and low energy. Usually, it presents in the winter, though scientists don’t agree on why. Some suspect that it’s because a lack of sun exposure may contribute to decreased levels of serotonin, a hormone that regulates mood, as well as vitamin D, which helps stimulate serotonin activity. Another theory links low exposure to sunlight with unusually high levels of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/03/seasonal-affective-disorder-winter-depression/673377/?utm_source=feed">Read: The surprising truth about seasonal depression</a>]</i></p><p>Summer SAD is generally accepted as a variety of the disorder, but it’s much rarer than the winter form; one <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032725012492">study</a> from earlier this year puts its prevalence at about 0.6 percent. That makes summer SAD especially hard to study. “It’s clearly a different kind of illness,” Paul Desan, a psychiatry professor at Yale, told me, but “it’s not in their imagination.” Unlike the winter form, which comes with a tendency to overeat, oversleep, and withdraw from society, summer SAD involves reduced appetite, insomnia, and restlessness—all of which can also be effects of heat. The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10696165/#:~:text=The%20relationship%20between%20heat%20and,topic%20have%20become%20more%20important.">scientific literature</a> shows that heat is associated with mood disorders, anxiety, aggression, and reduced cognitive abilities. Uncomfortably hot nights, longer periods of daylight, and extended stretches of time spent indoors all disrupt sleep, which can in turn fuel mood disorders, Amruta Nori-Sarma, an environmental-health professor at Harvard, told me. Extreme heat can also be an obstacle to exercising, spending time in nature, and socializing, all of which can make people feel good and also double as important coping mechanisms for emotional distress.</p><p>Taking comfort in air conditioning when it’s too hot out is a natural human response. But air-conditioned spaces can be stifling in their own way. Staying home where it’s cool also means socializing less; some offices and homes hardly let in a wink of sunlight all day. It’s plausible that in the summer, people experience SAD symptoms not only from excessive heat but also because they spend all of their time avoiding the sun, Kim Meidenbauer, a psychology professor at Washington State University, told me. “It does make sense to me that you’d have, potentially, an analogous pattern of effects” to winter SAD, she said. The link between indoor time and summer SAD hasn’t been studied, but plenty of Americans, even if they don’t meet the <em>DSM-5</em> criteria, are noticing that summer is starting to feel a lot like winter. Reddit abounds with users who lament that being forced indoors by the heat gives them “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tucson/comments/1lydnte/anyone_else_get_summer_depression_instead_of/">summer depression</a>.”</p><p>America’s summer quandary—suffer inside or out?—will become only more persistent as climate change intensifies. In the United States,<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-waves"> heat waves have grown more frequent and intense</a> every decade since the 1960s. During a single heat wave last month, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/millions-americans-told-stay-indoors-29-states-2089781">people in 29 states</a> were warned to stay inside to avoid dangerously high temperatures. All of the experts I spoke with expressed concerns about the impacts of escalating heat on mental health. “I am not optimistic,” Ayman Fanous, a psychiatry professor at the University of Arizona, told me, noting that heat also has a well-established link with suicide risk and can exacerbate mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and substance abuse. Many Americans don’t have access to air conditioning, or they work jobs that require them to be outside in the heat. Those who can stay cool inside may avoid the most severe consequences but still end up miserable for half of the year.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/heat-human-rights-issue-21st-century/616693/?utm_source=feed">Read: Earth’s new gilded era</a>]</i></p><p>As long as summer SAD remains poorly understood, the options for addressing it will be limited. Treatment for winter SAD usually involves exposure to light boxes that mimic sunlight, but these aren’t recommended for summer SAD, because it might have a different neurobiological basis, Fanous said. For now, the first-line treatments are SSRIs such as Prozac—which can make people even more <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/hcp/clinical-guidance/heat-and-medications-guidance-for-clinicians.html">sensitive</a> to heat.</p><p>For those with the means, the best strategy for beating summer SAD might be to move somewhere cooler. After eight years in Phoenix, Gibson has had enough of hiding from the heat for six months at a time and is ready to leave behind what he believes is his own summer SAD. Later this year, he plans to move his family to Colorado, where he hopes to be able to bring his daughter out during daylight hours. Yet Colorado summers, too, are becoming <a href="https://cwcb.colorado.gov/focus-areas/hazards/climate#:~:text=In%20Colorado%2C%20climate%20change%20presents,air%20quality%20and%20recreational%20opportunities.">uncomfortably hot</a>—and the same goes around the country. Last month, Alaska issued its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/06/16/alaska-heat-advisory-climate-change/">first-ever heat advisory</a>. As summer temperatures continue to rise, perhaps Americans will start to look back with envy on the ways our forebears beat the heat. The hotter summer nights get, the more sleeping on the fire escape starts to sound like a luxury.</p></div>
