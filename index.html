He doesn‚Äôt want anyone reading anything about Jeffrey Epstein, or his own relationship with the late sex offender. And yet his intensive efforts to change the subject to something‚Äîanything‚Äîelse seem to bring only more scrutiny.</p><p>This evening, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/05/politics/trump-blanche-epstein-maxwell-vance-bondi-patel-meeting">CNN reported</a>, a group of top administration officials, including the vice president, attorney general, FBI director, and White House chief of staff, had been planning to gather to discuss whether to release the recording of an interview between Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker and an Epstein associate, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Then, this afternoon, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/vp-vance-meeting-discuss-epstein-fallout-canceled-source-says-2025-08-06/">Reuters</a> reported the meeting had been canceled, with Vice President J. D. Vance‚Äôs spokesperson denying that it had ever even been planned. Yesterday, Republicans in the House subpoenaed the Justice Department for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/nx-s1-5493371/house-oversight-committee-epstein-subpoenas-justice-department">some records related to Epstein</a>.</p><p>As the Epstein story‚Äôs lock on headlines enters its second month, the president has employed three main tactics to try to dislodge it. First, he has ordered his supporters to stop talking about Epstein. ‚ÄúTheir new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‚Äòbullshit,‚Äô hook, line, and sinker,‚Äù he wrote, part of a long and anguished <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114863203348237352">Truth Social post</a> on July 16. This has been somewhat effective in certain quarters: In the days after Trump‚Äôs pleas, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/media/trump-epstein-fox-news-maga-media-charlie-kirk">Fox News</a> aired less coverage of the story.</p><p>Trying to stifle coverage this way has flaws. Much of the interest in Epstein originated in MAGA media itself, so claiming that these supporters fell for a hoax is dodgy‚Äîespecially when the attorney general and the FBI director were among the foremost <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/07/trump-epstein-scandal-maga-base/683571/?utm_source=feed">merchants of innuendo</a>. And it almost goes without saying that screaming at people not to pay attention to a topic will only make them suspect there‚Äôs something to see.</p><p>Some Trump-aligned outlets may be willing to take his lead, but other media organizations are not. A press that might have treated the Epstein story as either old news or somewhat prurient just a few months ago is now eager to find new information about it. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/trump-epstein-late-stage-conspiracism/683570/?utm_source=feed">Julie K. Brown</a>, the <i>Miami Herald </i>reporter who doggedly pursued the story, is the most desired guest on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/19/opinion/interesting-times-julie-k-brown-epstein.html">podcast circuit</a>. Just yesterday, <i>The New York Times </i>published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/us/jeffrey-epstein-mansion-photos.html">photos of unclear provenance</a> showing the inside of Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan townhouse.</p><p>Second, Trump has tried to change the subject, whether that‚Äôs attempting to breathe new life into his claims of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/russia-hoax-trump-2016-election/683770/?utm_source=feed">Russia hoax</a>,‚Äù threatening to federalize the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114977985620971126">District of Columbia</a>, or taking a walk on the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-ways-spend-money-white-house-roof/story?id=124385658">White House roof</a>. Distraction has long been an effective tactic for Trump, but it‚Äôs also a familiar one. Trump‚Äôs efforts have produced an amusing dynamic where no matter what he does, many people treat it as an attempt to distract from Epstein, which only points back to Epstein. Trump also keeps stepping on his own ploys. When the president announced the return of the Presidential Fitness Test last week, he invited the Hall of Fame linebacker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6528412/2025/07/31/trump-executive-order-presidential-fitness-test/">Lawrence Taylor</a> to join him. But Taylor is a sex offender, having pleaded guilty in connection with paying a 16-year-old to have sex with him. This was not only a strange invitation on its own; it was also a reminder about Trump‚Äôs former friend Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs sex trafficking of girls.</p><p>Third, the Trump administration and its GOP allies have tried to provide at least some information to the public, in the hope that it will sate appetites. Frequently, these moves have just whetted them. The Justice Department released what it said was ‚Äúraw‚Äù footage from the jail where Epstein died, only for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-fbis-jeffrey-epstein-prison-video-had-nearly-3-minutes-cut-out/"><i>Wired</i></a><i> </i>to report that the tape was, in fact, spliced. (Attorney General Pam Bondi attributed the missing footage to a quirk of the security-camera system, though government <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/">sources</a> who spoke to CBS News disputed that explanation.) Blanche‚Äôs interview with Maxwell is at least ostensibly an attempt to find new information, though it lends itself to further conspiracy theories about backroom agreements. This is especially true given Maxwell‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-federal-prison-texas-rcna222497">unexplained move</a> to a minimum-security prison shortly after the interview, as well as Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/28/trump-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-pardon">refusal to rule out pardoning her</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has called for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-johnson-jeffrey-epstein-not-a-hoax/">‚Äúfull transparency‚Äù</a> about Epstein, yet he also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/politics/mike-johnson-ends-house-session-epstein-vote.html">adjourned the House</a> rather than hold a vote on releasing files related to the case. The mystery of the reported planned meeting scheduled for tonight is more fuel for intrigue.</p><p>When Trump himself has spoken out recently, he has brought only more attention to the matter, to borrow his <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/israel-iran-trump-truth-social/683306/?utm_source=feed">phrase</a>. The president was evidently aware of Epstein‚Äôs sexual proclivities‚Äî‚ÄúIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,‚Äù he told <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/"><i>New York </i>magazine</a> in 2002‚Äîbut has said that he didn‚Äôt know about Epstein‚Äôs criminal activity. For years, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-partied-together-then-an-oceanfront-palm-beach-mansion-came-between-them/2019/07/31/79f1d98c-aca0-11e9-a0c9-6d2d7818f3da_story.html">reports</a> indicated that Trump had fallen out with Epstein, a longtime friend, over a real-estate matter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/trump-epstein-files-island.html">Last week</a>, however, Trump suggested that their clash came after Epstein ‚Äústole‚Äù <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/virginia-giuffres-family-donald-trump-knew-jeffrey-epstein/story?id=124238103">employees from Mar-a-Lago</a>‚Äîpossibly including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/politics/trump-epstein-virginia-giuffre-mar-a-lago.html">Virginia Giuffre</a>, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide in April. This drew understandable <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-trump/683717/?utm_source=feed">outrage</a> from Giuffre‚Äôs family but also raised questions about what Trump might have known about Epstein‚Äôs trafficking.</p><p>And when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhuOEfk1FsKc2oKSgVMJK5JCc-kQuHAolDJvLzctKvB1dvQJrNkGCwAO2cJAio%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68936fea&amp;gaa_sig=JcMts31zATYzdU2zwRgGO0g9i8AVnFmgA35WnrpFE7h7I4sxV20EsN0IfNWtd1KwTXL3k9vlTQPdlDWLdQpcvA%3D%3D"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a><i> </i>reported on a letter the president had allegedly written to Epstein, Trump denied writing the letter but also insisted that he‚Äôd never made drawings‚Äîwhich elicited plenty of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/18/trump-epstein-drawings/">examples</a> of past doodles, weakening his excuse. His splashy defamation lawsuit and demand to promptly depose the <i>Journal</i>‚Äôs owner, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/trump-murdoch-epstein-health-deposition-delay.html">Rupert Murdoch</a>, fanned the flames. (The paper says it stands by its reporting.)</p><p>Yesterday, I wrote about how Trump talks about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/russia-hoax-trump-2016-election/683770/?utm_source=feed">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election. In that case, Trump‚Äôs heated denials fed a belief among many of his critics that he must be hiding something. But the juiciest rumors did not prove true; the worst of the scandal had already been made public. Perhaps the same is true of Epstein: We already know that Trump was friends with him, and we already know that Trump was seemingly aware of his interest in young women. If Trump isn‚Äôt hiding anything, though, he‚Äôs not doing a good job of convincing <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/trump-epstein-case-poll-results/65589543">the public</a> of that.</p><p><b>Related:</b></p><ul>

<p>Enough With the Mom Guilt Already</p><p><i>By Maytal Eyal</i></p><blockquote>
<p>As I inch closer to motherhood and all of the unknowns that come with it, I sometimes feel as if my entire future is suspended in midair: How might my <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/motherhood-parenting-personality-change/681440/?utm_source=feed">personality shift</a>? What will my child be like? How will my marriage change? In the midst of that uncertainty, therapy culture tells moms, <i>You can ensure that your kid will grow up to be happy and healthy if ‚Ä¶ </i>and then provides a guidebook of tips to read and details to obsess over. In a country where mothers receive so little structural support‚Äîwhere community has eroded, maternity leave is minimal, and child-care costs can be astronomical‚Äîthe promise that parents alone can conjure all of the stability their child might need can feel like a warm hug. But really, that promise can be a trap.</p>

<p>To be clear, I‚Äôm not arguing that moms shouldn‚Äôt work on their own mental health, or that they shouldn‚Äôt think deeply about their approach to parenting. Rather, I worry that therapy culture prompts mothers to gaze obsessively, unhealthily inward, and deflects attention from the external forces (cultural, economic, political) that are actually the source of so much anxiety.</p>

                        <div class="content"><p>As New York Governor Kathy Hochul denounced the GOP‚Äôs aggressive attempt to gerrymander Democrats into political oblivion this week, she lamented her party‚Äôs built-in disadvantage. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back,‚Äù she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/04/hochul-embraces-gerrymandering-in-new-york-00492008">told</a> reporters.</p><p>As political metaphors go, it‚Äôs not a bad one. Hochul omitted a key detail, however: Democrats provided the rope themselves. For more than a decade, they‚Äôve <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/democrats-redistricting-gerrymandering-majority-midterms/620403/?utm_source=feed">tried</a> to be the party of good government on redistricting. But Democrats‚Äô support for letting independent commissions draw legislative maps has cost them seats in key blue states, and their push to ban gerrymandering nationwide flopped <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/partisan-gerrymandering-supreme-court-north-carolina/592741/?utm_source=feed">in the courts</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/06/democrats-senate-voting-rights/619269/?utm_source=feed">in Congress</a>.</p><p>Now that Republicans, at the behest of President Donald Trump, are moving quickly <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/07/texas-gerrymandering-districts-house-congress/683716/?utm_source=feed">to redraw</a> district lines in Texas and elsewhere in a bid to lock in their tenuous House majority, Democrats want to match them seat for seat in the states that they control. But the knots they‚Äôve tied are hard to undo.</p><p>To boost the GOP‚Äôs chances of winning an additional five House seats in Texas next year, all Governor Greg Abbott had to do was call the state‚Äôs deeply conservative legislature back to Austin for an emergency session to enact new congressional maps. The proposed changes carve up Democratic seats in Texas‚Äôs blue urban centers of Dallas, Houston, and Austin, as well as two seats along the U.S.-Mexico border, where Republicans are betting they can retain support among Latino voters who have moved right during the Trump era. Democratic lawmakers are trying to block the move by leaving the state and denying Republicans a required quorum in the legislature.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/07/texas-gerrymandering-districts-house-congress/683716/?utm_source=feed">Read: Republicans want to redraw America‚Äôs political map</a>]</i></p><p>By comparison, Democrats face a much longer and more arduous process to do the same in California and New York. Voters in both states would have to approve constitutional amendments to repeal or circumvent the nonpartisan redistricting commissions that Democrats helped enact. In California, Democrats hope to pass legislation this month that would put the question to voters this November. If the amendment is approved, the legislature could implement the new districts for the 2026 election. In New York, the legislature must pass the change in two separate sessions, meaning that a newly gerrymandered congressional map could not take effect until 2028 at the earliest.</p><p>By then, some Democrats fear it may be too late. Republicans want to gain seats through mid-decade redistricting not only in Texas but in GOP-controlled states such as <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article311583472.html">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/05/missouri-redistricting-2026-midterms-00494356">Missouri</a>, <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/08/01/congressional-redistricting-on-the-ohio-legislatures-fall-docket/">Ohio</a>, and <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/05/indiana-republican-redistricting-congressional-seat-democrat-election-trump-midterm/85521891007/">Indiana</a>. The GOP goal is to secure enough seats to withstand an electoral backlash to Trump‚Äôs presidency in next year‚Äôs midterms.</p><p>That imbalance has caused Democrats to reassess‚Äîand in some cases, abandon altogether‚Äîtheir support for rules they long championed as essential to maintaining a fair playing field on which both parties could compete. ‚ÄúWhat is at stake here is nothing less than the potential for permanent one-party control of the House of Representatives, and the threat of that to our democracy absolutely dwarfs any unfortunately quaint notions about the value of independent redistricting,‚Äù Micah Lasher, a New York State assembly member who represents Manhattan‚Äôs Upper West Side, told me. It‚Äôs a reversal for Lasher, a former Hochul aide who won office last year while <a href="https://citizensunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AD69_MicahLasher.pdf">endorsing</a> independent redistricting.</p><p>Lasher is the author of legislation that would allow New York to redraw its congressional maps in the middle of a decade if another state does so first. Lawmakers there could consider the bill when they return to Albany in January. The proposal is limited in scope: It does not throw out the state‚Äôs decennial post-Census redistricting process and merely creates an exception allowing New York to respond to other states‚Äô moves. This is partly due to worries that voters might reject a more aggressive plan; in 2021, New York Democrats and election reformers failed to win approval of a series of statewide referenda aimed at expanding access to voting. (Republicans don‚Äôt face the same concerns, because voters in red states won‚Äôt have a direct say in the maps they draw.)</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/democrats-redistricting-gerrymandering-majority-midterms/620403/?utm_source=feed">Read: The decision that could doom Democrats for a decade</a>]</i></p><p>Proposals like Lasher‚Äôs have won the support of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/02/us/politics/eric-holder-democrats-gerrymandering.html">Democrats</a> who previously led the fight to ban gerrymandering. On Monday, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee became the first party organization to formally call for Democrats to redraw congressional maps in states where they have the power to do so. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at a country where everything has changed, quite frankly, and the things that you thought could not happen happen,‚Äù Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the majority leader of the New York state Senate and the chair of DLCC‚Äôs board, told me.</p><p>Even as they pursued a national ban on gerrymandering, Democrats never forswore the practice entirely. Indeed, their ability to respond to Republicans now is constrained in part by the fact that district lines in blue states such as Illinois and Maryland are already skewed heavily in their favor. (Democrats control the legislature and governorships of far fewer states than do Republicans, which further limits their power to match the GOP in gerrymandering.)¬†¬†</p><p>Yet Republicans‚Äô recent moves, aided by a Supreme Court ruling that sidelined federal courts from striking down purely partisan (as opposed to racial) gerrymanders, represent an escalation that has stunned Democrats. I asked Stewart-Cousins whether the party‚Äôs push to take politics out of redistricting, which has succeeded in protecting one out of five congressional seats from the threat of gerrymandering, was misguided. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a mistake,‚Äù she insisted, casting the party‚Äôs new posture more as a temporary shift than a permanent reorientation.</p><p>Lasher, however, wasn‚Äôt so sure. ‚ÄúIt is fair to say that Democrats in New York and around the country vastly underestimated the willingness of the Republican Party to cross every line, break every norm, and do so with enormous speed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a period of adjustment. We better adjust really damn quickly.‚Äù</p></div>

America250 had been founded by Congress as a bipartisan effort, with a mission to engage ‚Äú350 million Americans for the 250th.‚Äù But Trump kicked off the final year of preparations with a political rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, attacking Democrats before a crowd that waved <span class="smallcaps">America</span>250 signs. ‚ÄúI hate them,‚Äù Trump proclaimed July 3. ‚ÄúI cannot stand them, because I really believe they hate our country.‚Äù</p><p>Around the same time, Trump‚Äôs top political appointee at America250, a former Fox News producer named <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/america-250th-birthday-party-fox-news/683167/?utm_source=feed">Ariel Abergel</a>, moved to gain greater influence over the bipartisan commission. He called four Republican commissioners, who had been appointed years ago by then‚ÄìSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan and then‚ÄìSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with a blunt request: Consider resigning to make way for new appointees.</p><p>That request was reiterated by current <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2025/01/how-mike-johnson-kept-his-speakership/681213/?utm_source=feed">House Speaker Mike Johnson</a>, who applied pressure to one appointee at the request of the White House. But rather than solidify Trump‚Äôs control over the organization, the calls appear to have backfired, setting off a struggle for control of the organization, according to interviews with eight people briefed on the recent turmoil in the organization, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>The four targeted commissioners ultimately refused to resign, despite two initially signaling their intent to comply. Johnson‚Äôs office decided to back off, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/john-thune-senate-trump-gop/680643/?utm_source=feed">Senate Majority Leader John Thune</a> has indicated that he seeks no changes to the commission, according to people familiar with their thinking. Then other members of the commission, which Abergel works for, began discussing efforts to push him out of his job, arguing that his decision to ask for the resignations demonstrated his lack of judgement.</p><p>‚ÄúThis position should have been reserved for a much more experienced and substantive candidate,‚Äù one of the commissioners told me, reflecting the views expressed by others. ‚ÄúThe 250th is too important as a milestone for our country to jeopardize it with someone who doesn‚Äôt take it seriously.‚Äù</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/trump-american-parade-military/683144/?utm_source=feed">T. H. Breen: Trump‚Äôs un-American parade</a>]</i></p><p>Abergel defended his actions and argued that he had been acting in concert with the House speaker to request that ‚Äúcertain inactive members of the commission‚Äù resign. ‚ÄúThe speaker has every right to make his own appointments to the commission,‚Äù he told me in a statement. ‚ÄúWhile some anonymous individuals are focused on lying to the fake news, my focus remains the same: to make America250 the most patriotic celebration in American history.‚Äù</p><p>The nation‚Äôs leaders have been planning since 2016 for next year‚Äôs celebrations to mark the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which are expected to involve events in each of the states, including a ball drop in Times Square on July 4, organized in partnership with the commission. The Republican tax bill that Trump signed into law this summer included an additional $150 million for the Department of Interior, which is expected to be spent by the commission in partnership with a new White House task force to celebrate the anniversary, with additional private fundraising from companies such as Coca-Cola and Stellantis. But now, even as the festivities are unfolding, the commission that was established to oversee them is in turmoil.</p><p class="dropcap">S<span class="smallcaps">ince winning reelection</span>, Trump has moved swiftly to take control of the federal government‚Äôs cultural institutions, including the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/trump-kennedy-center-arts/681613/?utm_source=feed">Kennedy Center</a> and the National Portrait Gallery. But the United States Semiquincentennial Commission answers largely to the legislative branch, not the White House, and has a sprawling leadership structure that includes sitting senators, members of Congress, and ex officio members such as the secretary of defense and the secretary of state.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/guster-kennedy-center-shows/682374/?utm_source=feed">Ryan Miller: Why I played the Kennedy Center</a>]</i></p><p>The power to direct the operation resides with an additional 16 ‚Äúprivate citizen‚Äù commissioners, who are appointed in equal numbers by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate for lifetime terms until the completion of the celebrations. Under the law, the forcible removal of commissioners requires a two-thirds vote of the commission, and the president‚Äôs main power is his ability to appoint a chair from among the private citizens already serving.</p><p>According to four people familiar with the conversations, the four commissioners whom Abergel asked to resign are the Washington and Lee University professor Lucas Morel, the Hillsdale College professor Wilfred M. McClay, the educator Val Crofts, and Tom Walker, the founder of American Village, a historical-replica development in Alabama. Morel and McClay declined to comment. Crofts and Walker could not be reached for comment. Two people familiar with the commission‚Äôs work described all four as regular participants in America250 oversight.</p><p>For the moment, there does not appear to be public pressure from Capitol Hill for a shake-up. ‚ÄúJohnson is not seeking the resignation of any of the speaker‚Äôs appointees,‚Äù a person familiar with his thinking, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation, told me. Someone familiar with Thune‚Äôs thinking gave me a similar response: ‚ÄúThune supports his appointees.‚Äù</p><p>People familiar with the White House planning for America250 have argued that the commission needs more commitment of time and energy from its commissioners for the final year before next summer‚Äôs festivities. They told me that the attempt to encourage resignations was blocked, ultimately, by commission bylaws that limit the ability of congressional offices to push out a commissioner. And they made clear that efforts to change the commission makeup could continue.</p><p>‚ÄúSo far, the best work they have done is being part of this loyal cabal,‚Äù one person familiar with the White House thinking on the sitting commission told me. ‚ÄúThere has been tremendous frustration with the lack of programmatic purpose, planning, and production.‚Äù</p><p>Others involved in the commission say that such arguments are merely a pretext for political control. Some of the people familiar with the discussion suspect that the White House wants to replace the four Republican commissioners‚Äîwho are largely apolitical historical boosters and academics‚Äîwith people more directly loyal to Trump, including one whom the president could then elevate to replace the commission‚Äôs chairwoman, Rosie Rios, a former U.S. treasurer during the Obama administration. Republican appointees have been targeted, they argue, because Democratic leaders have no say in who would replace them. (Just this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer filled two Democratic vacancies on the commission, appointing Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F. Kennedy, and Paul R. Tetreault, the director of Ford‚Äôs Theatre, according to a person briefed on the appointments.) White House allies contest this argument, saying Trump could elevate an existing Republican commissioner at any time to replace Rios.</p><p>Rios allowed the White House to appoint Abergel as the executive director this year, according to people familiar with the conversations. The commission‚Äôs executive committee, a group led by Rios, then approved the use of the America250 brand and nonprofit for this summer‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photography/archive/2025/06/trump-military-parade-photos/683196/?utm_source=feed">military parade</a> and Trump rallies, allowing Trump‚Äôs fundraisers to bring in money to fund the events and green-lighting their production by his former campaign team.</p><p>But since then, a group of Democratic lawmakers on the commission has questioned the arrangement. Rios has signaled that all future programming decisions will be made with the consultation of the full commission. In an email update sent to the commission on Saturday, which I obtained, Rios recounted a recent planning meeting with White House officials, including Vince Haley, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, and Brittany Baldwin from TaskForce250, a separate body Trump set up to commemorate the semiquincentennial in concert with the commission.</p><p>‚ÄúI am pleased to report that we are in agreement about the Commission‚Äôs vision and how to support and amplify other proposed activities,‚Äù Rios wrote in the email. ‚ÄúAs I explained at our last Commission meeting, moving forward, my commitment to this Commission is that any proposed changes to our Playbook will come back to the full Commission for approval.‚Äù</p><p>The White House spokesperson Anna Kelly praised the commission when asked for comment for this story. ‚ÄúThe White House is extremely pleased with the America250 Commission, which is doing a great job leading this historic, unifying celebration of our country‚Äôs 250th anniversary,‚Äù she told me in a statement.</p><p class="dropcap">T<span class="smallcaps">he power struggle</span> between Abergel and some members of the commission has been building for reasons beyond the Trump events. Abergel has suggested that ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Field Trip,‚Äù a contest in which students create art celebrating the country, be moved to a Cabinet agency. Commissioners pushed back against that change. A redesign of the website that Abergel directed added photos of Trump along with corporate logos of the companies funding Trump‚Äôs parade, and removed any mention of the Ambassador Circle, which named people including the musician Lance Bass, the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown as representatives of the effort. Some people on the commission were alarmed by a recent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Moms4Liberty/posts/pfbid02DNFAWr94mSTjaExAx8ay3C25oifLoFEPk5maijFp67ypDtGB8NndQknGzZqaqQcHl">Facebook post</a> announcing an America250 partnership with Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that wants to ban certain books from school curricula and opposes the teaching of liberal ideas of race and gender.</p><p>‚ÄúThe branding and marketing had turned strongly around President Trump and strongly partisan looking,‚Äù another person familiar with the commission‚Äôs discussions told me. ‚ÄúThe commissioners are united in what is best for America and a great celebration.‚Äù</p><p>Four Democrats on the commission, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, California Senator Alex Padilla, Pennsylvania Representative Dwight Evans, and New Jersey Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, wrote to Rios and Abergel on July 21, asking about the Trump events and requesting assurances that the commission‚Äôs programming will be implemented. ‚ÄúThe Chair intends that the Commission and Foundation personnel will execute and implement all approved programming,‚Äù Rios and Abergel responded yesterday in a letter, which I obtained.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/cohen-military-parade/683143/?utm_source=feed">Eliot A. Cohen: A parade of ignorance</a>]</i></p><p>They told the lawmakers in the letter that the commission had paid for logistics and operations support for the early-summer events headlined by Trump. But congressionally appropriated funds were not used through America250 to directly fund the military parade commemorating the Army‚Äôs 250th anniversary, the Fort Bragg speech, or the July 3 Iowa kickoff rally for the semiquincentennial.</p><p>To pay for the efforts, Trump‚Äôs political fundraiser, Meredith O‚ÄôRouke, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/america-250th-birthday-party-fox-news/683167/?utm_source=feed">began raising money</a> for America250 Inc., a foundation created at the behest of the commission. Donors were offered a ‚Äúdedicated VIP experience‚Äù at the events, according to fundraising documents. America250 subsequently announced donations from a list of companies with executives close to Trump who stand to benefit from his presidency, including Oracle, Lockheed Martin, Ultimate Fighting Championship, Coinbase, Palantir, and Amazon.</p><p>A person briefed on the spending said that America250 ultimately budgeted $33 million for the parade, the Fort Bragg rally, the Iowa rally, a West Point speech, and other events. Of that, $20 million was budgeted for the parade. Army officials have separately said the parade cost the military $30 million to stage, including $3 million to prepare street surfaces for heavy vehicles.</p><p>Trump previously announced that he plans to stage an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout at the White House in honor of the nation‚Äôs 250th birthday. People familiar with the planning say that the fight is likely to be organized through the White House task force, not the Semiquincentennial Commission.</p></div>

                        <div class="content"><p>Last week, the National Institutes of Health finally got some good news. A Senate subcommittee voted, with support from both parties, to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/31/nih-budget-senate-committee-replaces-trump-cuts-with-400-million-increase/">increase the agency‚Äôs $48 billion budget</a>‚Äîa direct rebuke to the Trump administration‚Äôs proposed budget, which would have slashed the agency‚Äôs funding some 40 percent. After the administration spent months battering the NIH with funding freezes, mass firings, and waves of grant terminations, that Senate vote was one of the only clear signals since January that at least some leaders in the U.S. government were committed to preserving the NIH‚Äôs status as the world‚Äôs largest public funder of biomedical research.</p><p></p><p>But inside the agency, officials could not wholeheartedly celebrate. Its political leadership has shredded the NIH playbook so thoroughly, current and former NIH officials told me, that even at current funding levels they are unable to perform their core work of vetting and powering some of the best scientific research around the world. One official told me many of their co-workers are worried that ‚Äúeven if we get the money, we won‚Äôt be allowed to spend it somehow.‚Äù (Several of the current and former NIH officials I spoke with for this story requested anonymity for fear of professional repercussions.)</p><p></p><p>At this point in the summer, NIH officials are always rushing to spend the agency‚Äôs remaining funds before the fiscal year ends on September 30. ‚ÄúMore grants get processed during the fourth quarter than at any other time,‚Äù one former NIH official who oversaw grants told me. Usually, they make the deadline. This year, though, the Trump administration‚Äôs blocks to grant-making and cuts to staff have left those remaining so far behind that many of the agency‚Äôs 27 institutes and centers will fall far short of using up the money they‚Äôve been allocated, several officials told me.</p><p></p><p>If those funds are unspent, the NIH will be forced to return a massive sum to the Treasury‚Äîwhich several current and former NIH officials are afraid could be used to justify future budget cuts. The administration ‚Äúis setting them up to fail,‚Äù the former official told me. In the United States, government agencies need Congress to fund them, but the executive branch still runs them. The Trump administration is no longer allowing the NIH to function as an agency that can handle a $47 billion budget.</p><p></p><p>When reached for comment, an NIH spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency is ‚Äúcommitted to restoring academic freedom, cutting red tape, and accelerating the delivery of grants to support rigorous, truth-based science,‚Äù and that it is ‚Äúfocused on empowering our workforce, removing bureaucratic obstacles, and fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration.‚Äù The officials operating under these principles see it differently: ‚ÄúIt is an ongoing siege,‚Äù one of them told me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre losing all capacity to act,‚Äù another said. ‚ÄúAnd we are losing hope.‚Äù For decades, the NIH‚Äôs primary function has been <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/nih-grant-terminations/682039/?utm_source=feed">distributing billions of dollars</a>‚Äîthe bulk of its budget‚Äîto the American biomedical-research community<em>.</em> This year, though, the agency‚Äôs ability to get its funds out the door has faltered in ways it never has before: A <em>STAT</em> analysis found that, as of mid-June, the agency has awarded 12,000 fewer grants and about 30 percent less in funding‚Äî<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/27/despite-resumption-of-nih-grant-reviews-research-funding-gap-grew/">at least $4.7 billion</a>‚Äîthan it typically would have by that point in the year.</p><p></p><p>To mete out those funds, the agency pores over <a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/report/289">at least tens of thousands of grant applications</a> every year, subjecting them to reviews from multiple panels of experts; <a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/category/10">only about 20 percent are funded</a>, or sometimes <a href="https://www.aaci-cancer.org/Files/Admin/Commentary%20Archive/2022-December-AACI-Commentary.pdf">far less</a>. The agency then monitors researchers‚Äô progress, disbursing funds incrementally over the course of several years. But since January, political appointees ‚Äúhave been successfully clogging up the system in every place it could be clogged,‚Äù Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the National Cancer Institute, told me. The administration has blocked the agency from notifying researchers of new funding opportunities; it has held up the meetings required for reviewing applications. It has instructed officials to scour grant applications for references to diversity, gender, climate change, and other concepts that the current political leaders want to erase from scientific inquiry, then to sideline those proposals. It has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/nih-grant-freeze-biomedical-research/681853/?utm_source=feed">frozen payments meant to go out to researchers</a>, essentially cutting them and their staff off from their salaries. And it has, over months, pushed the NIH to cancel grants that the agency had already awarded, at a scale NIH officials told me they‚Äôve never experienced‚Äî<a href="https://grant-witness.us/nih-data.html">thousands</a> of grants canceled not, as in the past, for ethical violations or because logistical hurdles made the research impossible to advance, but <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/nih-grant-terminations/682039/?utm_source=feed">because they conflicted with the administration‚Äôs political goals</a>.</p><p></p><p>Many of these disruptions have been reversed, in some cases, within days or even hours. But at an agency where policy changes have typically been painstaking, heavily deliberated affairs, the onslaught of sudden shifts has left officials feeling exhausted, afraid, and hamstrung‚Äîunable to fund science at the rate they once could. ‚ÄúNo one can function under this kind of whiplash,‚Äù Kobrin told me. ‚ÄúPeople are joking about getting neck braces.‚Äù</p><p></p><p>Last Tuesday, officials endured yet another jarring U-turn. First, news broke that the Office of Management and Budget had <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/29/trump-administration-omb-blocks-nih-grant-awards/">barred</a> the NIH from spending its funds on anything but staff salaries and expenses‚Äîyet another blow to grant-making that effectively guaranteed that the agency‚Äôs already sluggish spending would completely stagnate. Then, hours later, senior White House officials <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-puts-new-chokehold-on-billions-in-health-research-funding-19660215?st=ts2fSp">intervened to reverse the decision</a>. The second round of information arrived so late at night, Kobrin told me, that the next morning, several of her colleagues hadn‚Äôt yet gotten the message and were scrambling to rejigger their spending plans.</p><p></p><p>The back-and-forth over grant cancellations has been especially demoralizing. When the grant terminations began, two grants-management officials told me, officials were forbidden from communicating with researchers, even as their voicemails and inboxes flooded with panicked questions. ‚ÄúIt was like dumping someone over text, and then blocking their number and ghosting them,‚Äù one of them said. That policy is no longer in place, but this means officials instead must tell researchers their funding has been paused or permanently severed, and struggle to explain why. After spending months cutting funds to researchers, many grants-management specialists then had to undo that work in a matter of days, after a federal judge ordered the agency to immediately reinstate hundreds of grants. And should the <a href="https://www.highereddive.com/news/ace-higher-ed-groups-supreme-court-nih-grants/756882/">Supreme Court rule in the administration‚Äôs favor</a>, ‚Äúmany of us figure we‚Äôre going to have to re-terminate all these grants anyway,‚Äù one grants-management official told me. That official has now helped award, terminate, then reinstate multiple grants‚Äîand may need to help terminate them again soon. In the meantime, officials are operating on two distinct sets of guidance: rules that apply to grants awarded to scientists in states subject to the recent court order, and Trump administration guidance that still holds everywhere else.</p><p></p><p>The job of ‚ÄúNIH official‚Äù has simply gotten much harder. New guidance arrives <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/nih-indirect-cost-memo-hhs/681736/?utm_source=feed">at odd hours, with impractical deadlines</a>. Several upheavals have rippled through the agency via closed-door meetings and hallway rumors, instead of with clear paper trails. The guidance issued, multiple officials told me, has also felt absolutist‚Äî<em>do this, or you‚Äôre fired</em>‚Äîwhile often coming off as so vague that, at times, different institutes have diverged in their interpretation, leaving funding policies inconsistent and officials unsure if they have made career-ending mistakes. ‚ÄúThe environment is clearly, they‚Äôre going to fire whoever they want for whatever reason they want,‚Äù one grants-management specialist told me. And looming over each new change is the possibility that officials are, once again, being asked to do something of sufficiently questionable legality that a court will quickly block it.</p><p></p><p>Many officials have quit or been fired, and every month, more are choosing to leave. One official told me that they have attended as many ‚Äúun-happy‚Äù hours in recent months to say good-bye to co-workers as they had been to over the past five years. ‚ÄúAnd those are just the ones I managed to go to‚ÄîI was invited to more,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúPeople just don‚Äôt leave that much. Or they didn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p><p></p><p>Officials still at the agency told me that the pileup of new policies, combined with staff departures, has saddled them with heavier workloads. ‚ÄúWe have more work to do with fewer people,‚Äù one official told me. And what work remains, that official said, feels as though it‚Äôs being done in molasses. ‚ÄúI cannot fulfill all the duties responsibly in the time required,‚Äù Theresa Kim, a program officer at the National Institute of Aging, told me. Twenty of the grants in her portfolio were supposed to start paying out to researchers on June 1, she told me. But staffing cuts‚Äîespecially losses from the grants-management team, which handles the budgetary aspect of grants‚Äîand endless back-and-forths over whether certain grants comported with new political priorities‚Äîmeant that a funding process that should have taken just a couple of weeks had instead dragged on for months. As of this week, Kim said, 14 of those research teams had yet to receive their federal funds.</p><p></p><p>When I asked officials what it would take for the NIH to feel normal again, most of them didn‚Äôt bring up the agency‚Äôs budget at all. They instead described more philosophical changes. They wanted to do their work under clear guidance and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/nih-bethesda-declaration-bhattacharya-letter/683081/?utm_source=feed">a supportive director</a>, without political interference or fear that their employment is constantly on the line. ‚ÄúLeave us alone,‚Äù one official told me. ‚ÄúLet us do our jobs.‚Äù Financially, the NIH‚Äîfor now‚Äîremains intact. The Senate has also pushed back on the Trump administration‚Äôs proposal to restructure the agency entirely. But the NIH is fast losing what turns out to be its most important resource: people.</p><p></p><p></p></div>

What struck me most was not so much the video itself‚Äî<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stephanne221/video/7272132830472277290?q=how%20millennial%20parents%20will%20ruin%20their%20kids&amp;t=1749395628698">posts</a> like these are <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@attachmentnerd/video/7113963643997408555?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xJRbT53JYk">common</a> across social media‚Äîbut rather the comments section, which was riddled with maternal guilt: ‚ÄúI have SUCH a hard time playing with her,‚Äù a woman wrote of her daughter, ‚Äúand I hate it.‚Äù Another confessed, ‚ÄúI try so hard to play with my son but it‚Äôs hard and I feel horrible.‚Äù</p><p>In just a couple of months, I am going to become a mother. Reading those comments, I thought about all the moms I know: the ones barely holding it together after a long day, snapping at their toddlers and instantly regretting it; the ones stuck working late at the office, way past their kids‚Äô bedtime. I thought about myself, soon to be cradling a baby in a postpartum haze, trying to decide whether to bottle-feed or sleep train. And, as a psychologist, I thought about my work‚Äîin a field whose conventional advice has convinced generations of mothers that their smallest missteps might scar their children for life.</p><p>According to a certain brand of parenting advice, motherhood isn‚Äôt just caregiving; it‚Äôs also a series of psychological interventions that can make or break a child‚Äôs future. ‚ÄúHow we respond to our children on a moment-to-moment basis creates a pattern that our children may follow for a lifetime,‚Äù the mindfulness expert Hunter Clarke-Fields writes in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781684033881"><i>Raising Good Humans</i></a>. ‚ÄúWant your daughter to stand up for herself when she‚Äôs uncomfortable in a hookup or dating scenario?‚Äù Becky Kennedy (a.k.a. ‚ÄúDr. Becky‚Äù) asks in her parenting bible, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780063159488"><i>Good Inside</i></a>. ‚ÄúIf, when she was a child, her parents validated her perceptions and wired her for self-trust, she‚Äôll be more inclined to say, ‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm not comfortable with that.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>I think of this type of advice as a manifestation of what I call ‚Äútherapy culture‚Äù‚Äîthe growing landscape of Instagram posts, self-care products, and self-improvement guides that encourage ongoing self-scrutiny and the pursuit of constant personal betterment. Many of these books and posts are written to address all parents, but, ultimately, moms tend to be their greatest consumers. And their message for moms can be incredibly seductive: Do enough ‚Äúwork‚Äù on yourself‚Äîregulate your nervous system, master emotional attunement, follow the rules of <a href="https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/attachment-parenting/">attachment parenting</a>‚Äîand you can safeguard your child‚Äôs psychological future.</p><p>In a part of life as high-stakes and unpredictable as motherhood, this promise of control might feel reassuring. But it is ultimately an illusion, one that is based on shaky science, and that diverts attention from the material realities that can make parenting so difficult in the first place.</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">When you consider the</span> origins of modern psychotherapy as it relates to parenting, you quickly realize that the discipline was hardly built to support mothers. In 1946, Edward Strecker, a psychiatrist and former president of the American Psychiatric Association, used the term<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4dh953k1"> <i>momism</i></a> to describe how overbearing, emasculating mothers had supposedly rendered 2 million American men psychologically unfit for war. Soon afterward, the cold, distant<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60546-7/fulltext"> <i>schizophrenogenic mother</i></a> was blamed for causing schizophrenia, and the emotionally remote<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137328533_5"> <i>refrigerator mom</i></a> was blamed for causing autism. Some even attributed physical conditions such as eczema to flawed mothering. ‚ÄúThe mother‚Äôs personality,‚Äù the psychoanalyst Ren√© Spitz <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.138790">claimed</a> in 1951, ‚Äúacts as a disease-provoking agent, a psychological toxin.‚Äù</p><p>Today, such theories may seem like relics‚Äîdebunked, disavowed, left behind by a more enlightened field. But mother-blaming never really disappeared; it just changed shape. Now psychologists don‚Äôt accuse moms of causing schizophrenia or autism. Still, you might hear some talking about ‚Äútrauma‚Äù and ‚Äúattachment wounds.‚Äù This kind of language may sound more compassionate. But a common implication remains: <i>Moms, if you screw up early on, your kids will carry the consequences forever</i>.</p><p>Whether or not they‚Äôve gone to therapy (which, of course, many Americans haven‚Äôt), Millennial and Gen Z moms grew up in a media environment animated by that core idea. Therapy-speak aimed at moms has seeped into the television shows that many people watch, the books they read, the talk shows they listen to. As a kid growing up in the ‚Äô90s and early aughts, I still remember the sound of Oprah and Dr. Phil opining in the background after school about topics such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3334944/?ref_=ttep_ep_35">‚Äúout-of-control moms‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a44343646/the-oprah-winfrey-show-clip-childhood-trauma/">childhood trauma</a>. Now these therapeutic narratives show up in podcasts, on social media, and in direct-to-consumer <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/05/mothers-day-email-opt-out/682715/?utm_source=feed">marketing emails</a>.</p><p>Along the way, many of us have internalized the theory that who we are and the reasons we suffer are largely determined by how we were raised‚Äîand that our failures, relationship problems, and inability to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/boundaries-psychology-therapy-mental-health/674882/?utm_source=feed">set boundaries</a> can be traced to our parents, especially our mothers. It should come as no surprise, then, that for many women, motherhood is suffused with <a href="https://www.mmhla.org/articles/maternal-mental-health-conditions-and-statistics">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inviting-monkey-tea/202211/recovering-mom-guilt">guilt</a>.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/12/therapy-language-anxiety-mental-health/676325/?utm_source=feed">Read: How anxiety became content</a>]</i></p><p>Yet the connection between how people turn out and how they are parented is not as direct‚Äîor as deterministic‚Äîas many have argued. In 1998, the psychology researcher Judith Rich Harris posited that the notion that parents are the crucial nurturers in children‚Äôs lives is ‚Äúnot a truism‚Äù but ‚Äúa cherished cultural myth.‚Äù Drawing on extensive research from across the field, Harris argued in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781439101650"><i>The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do</i></a> that parental influence pales when compared with other<i> </i>environmental factors‚Äîsuch as the influence of peers‚Äîin shaping who children become.</p><p>Numerous studies since then have backed up Harris‚Äôs core idea that parents don‚Äôt matter as much as many people think. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Beben-Benyamin/publication/276922271_Meta-analysis_of_the_heritability_of_human_traits_based_on_fifty_years_of_twin_studies/links/555dd99b08ae8c0cab2b9b9a/Meta-analysis-of-the-heritability-of-human-traits-based-on-fifty-years-of-twin-studies.pdf">Genes</a>, for example, seem to play a bigger role than the environment that children are raised in. And some research <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fraley-2019.pdf">on attachment theory</a> suggests that a child‚Äôs bond with their early caregiver has only a weak correlation with their relationship patterns as adults; those patterns are informed by a whole range of experiences beyond just parenting, including <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13713">friendships</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14616734.2022.2030132">major life stressors</a>. ‚ÄúIt is very difficult to find any reliable, empirical relation between the small variations in what parents do,‚Äù the developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik wrote in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781250132253"><i>The Gardener and the Carpenter</i></a>, ‚Äúand the resulting adult traits of their children.‚Äù</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">None of this is to say that</span> parenting doesn‚Äôt matter. To claim so would negate the real, long-term harm that can result from abuse and neglect, as well as the profound benefits of being deeply loved in childhood. But all of those micro-moments that parents are told will psychologically define their kids? Most of them won‚Äôt.</p><p>As I inch closer to motherhood and all of the unknowns that come with it, I sometimes feel as if my entire future is suspended in midair: How might my <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/motherhood-parenting-personality-change/681440/?utm_source=feed">personality shift</a>? What will my child be like? How will my marriage change? In the midst of that uncertainty, therapy culture tells moms, <i>You can ensure that your kid will grow up to be happy and healthy if ‚Ä¶ </i>and then provides a guidebook of tips to read and details to obsess over. In a country where mothers receive so little structural support‚Äîwhere community has eroded, maternity leave is minimal, and child-care costs can be astronomical‚Äîthe promise that parents alone can conjure all of the stability their child might need can feel like a warm hug. But really, that promise can be a trap.</p><p><i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/07/therapy-mental-health-school-kids/678911/?utm_source=feed">Read: Not everyone needs to go to therapy</a>]</i></p><p>To be clear, I‚Äôm not arguing that moms shouldn‚Äôt work on their own mental health, or that they shouldn‚Äôt think deeply about their approach to parenting. Rather, I worry that therapy culture prompts mothers to gaze obsessively, unhealthily inward, and deflects attention from the external forces (cultural, economic, political) that are actually the source of so much anxiety. When mothers chase psychological perfection, the result is rarely joy or any semblance of mental health. Instead, too many women are left with the gnawing feeling that, no matter how hard they work, they are likely to fall short‚Äîan outcome that benefits neither parents nor their children.</p>
