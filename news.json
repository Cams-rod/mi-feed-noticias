Last week, they took another step along this path by removing the first female <a href=\"https://www.navytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/07/21/hegseth-replaces-naval-academy-superintendent/\">head</a> of the United States Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Maryland.</p><p>The Naval Academy was founded in 1845, but didn’t admit its first class of women until 1976. The head of the school is known as the superintendent, and Annapolis would not get its first female admiral in that position until 2024. Now the first woman to serve as the “supe” has been reassigned and replaced by a man, and for the first time in the academy’s history, the role went to a Marine. Last week, the Navy removed Vice Admiral <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/Search/Article/2236396/vice-admiral-yvette-davids/\">Yvette Davids</a> from her post and replaced her with Lieutenant General <a href=\"https://www.manpower.marines.mil/About/Leaders/Biography/Article/3864243/deputy-commandant-manpower-and-reserve-affairs/\">Michael Borgschulte</a>. (Maybe Hegseth thinks Marines are more <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/08/warrior-myth-lethality-pete-hegseth/683247/?utm_source=feed\"><i>lethal</i></a>, to use his favorite Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.stevenhwilson.com/freedom-worship-word-will-not-speak/\">worship word</a>.) Davids has been sent to the Pentagon, where she will be a deputy chief of naval operations, a senior—but relatively invisible—position.</p><p>No reason was given for reassigning Davids. Superintendents typically serve for three to five years, but Davids was pulled from the job after 18 months. (A short tenure can be a sign of some sort of problem; for what it’s worth, the secretary of the Navy, John Phelan—who has never served in the Navy and has no background in national-defense issues—offered rote <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/07/17/marine-3-star-to-lead-naval-academy-davids-heading-to-opnav-staff\">praise</a> when announcing her de facto firing as the supe.)</p><p>Trump and Hegseth have been on a firing spree throughout the military, especially when it comes to removing women from senior positions. This past winter, the administration fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first female chief of naval operations; Admiral Linda Fagan, the first female Coast Guard commandant; and Lieutenant General Jennifer Short, who was serving as the senior military assistant to the secretary of defense, all within weeks of one another. I taught for many years at the U.S. Naval War College, where I worked under its first female president, Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield. In 2023, she became the U.S. military representative to the NATO Military Committee—and then she was fired in April, apparently in part because of a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shoshana-chatfield-admiral-to-nato-fired-senior-military-officers-ousted/\">presentation</a> she gave on Women’s Equality Day <i>10 years ago</i>.</p><p>At this point, women have been cleared out of all of the military’s top jobs. They are not likely to be replaced by other women: Of the three dozen four-star officers on active duty in the U.S. armed forces, none is female, and none of the administration’s pending appointments for senior jobs even at the three-star level is a woman.</p><p>Some observers might see a pattern here.</p><p>Discerning this pattern does not exactly require Columbo-level sleuthing. Hegseth’s antipathy toward women in the armed forces was well documented back in 2024 by none other than Hegseth himself. In his book <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-war-on-warriors-anon9780063389427/20719426?ean=9780063389427&amp;next=t\"><i>The War on Warriors</i></a>, Hegseth decried what he believed was “social engineering” by the American left: “While the American people had always rejected the radical-feminist so-called ‘Equal Rights Amendment,’ Team Obama could fast-track their social engineering through the military’s top-down chain of command.” (This is probably why Hegseth also fired the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General C. Q. Brown, who is a Black man; Brown was let go for ostensibly being too interested in promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/21/trump-hegseth-joint-chiefs-cq-brown-jr\">diversity</a> in the armed forces.)</p><p>Not that the secretary hates women, you should understand. Some of his best friends … well, as he put it in his book last year: “It’s not that individual women can’t be courageous, ambitious, and honorable. I know many phenomenal female soldiers. The problem is that the Left needs <i>every</i> woman to be as successful as every man, so they’ve redefined success in a counterproductive way.”</p><p>I’m sure that the more than 225,000 American women who serve their country in uniform are relieved to know that they, too, can be courageous, and all that other great stuff. But Hegseth seems to be implying that many women in today’s military might have had their fitness reports massaged “in a counterproductive way” to meet some sort of “woke” quota. And that, you see, is why the U.S. military’s most-senior female officers had to be removed: They were clearly part of some affirmative-action scheme. <i>Thank you for your service, ladies, but let’s remember that the Pentagon’s E-Ring is for the men</i>.</p><p>Oddly, Hegseth has no problem with “social engineering” as long as it’s engineering something closer to 1955 than 2025. Indeed, he writes, the military “has always been about social engineering—forging young men (mostly) with skills, discipline, pride, and a brotherhood.” One might think that the goal is also to instill respect for one’s comrades, regardless of gender, and to defend the country and honor the Constitution, but Hegseth is more worried about what he fears is the distracting influence of women in the military. “Men and women are different,” he writes, “with men being more aggressive.” (I read this in Cliff Clavin’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd6vzhwmup0\">voice</a>: “Yes, Diane … hold on to your hat, too, because the very letters <i>DNA</i> are an acronym for the words <i>Dames are Not Aggressive</i>.”) Hegseth goes on: “Men act differently toward women than they do other men. Men like women and are distracted by women. They also want to impress, and protect, women.”</p><p>In other words, after forging these neo-Spartans with some of the finest training from the most powerful military the world has ever known, Americans still must worry that these carbon-steel warriors, ready to do battle with any number of global menaces, might have their “lethality” sabotaged by the fluttering eyelashes and shapely gams of their sisters in arms.</p><p>I was teaching senior officers, male and female, from all branches of the armed forces when Hegseth was <a href=\"https://x.com/CitizenScreen/status/1946417295825264828\">still</a> in high school. His view of women in the U.S. military would be beneath serious comment were he not, through the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/01/the-hegseth-hearing-was-a-national-embarrassment/681315/?utm_source=feed\">malpractice</a> of the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, the sitting secretary of defense. Instead of defending the nation—or keeping track of the security of his own <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/06/signalgate-trump-atlantic-interview/682576/?utm_source=feed\">communications</a>—he is trying to make the American military inhospitable to half of the nation’s population.</p><p>As Nora Bensahel, a scholar of civil-military relations at Johns Hopkins University, told me, the firing of Davids and other women “is deliberately sending a chilling message to the women who are already serving in uniform, and to girls who may be thinking about doing so, that they are not welcome—even though the military would not be able to meet its recruiting numbers without those very same women.”</p><p>Today is my late mother’s birthday. She enlisted in the Air Force and served during the Korean War. She came from a poor family, and had to leave the military when her father was dying. But she was deeply proud of her service in America’s armed forces; I remember watching her march in uniform in hometown parades. She would be heartbroken—and furious—to know that more than a half century after her service, the message to the women of the United States from the current commander in chief and his secretary of defense amounts to a sexist warning: <i>Feel free to join the military and serve your country—but know your place</i>.</p><p><b>Related: </b></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/07/pete-hegseth-women-combat-troops/683454/?utm_source=feed\">The backdoor way that Pete Hegseth could keep women out of combat</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/07/razin-caine-donald-trump-joint-chiefs/683440/?utm_source=feed\">Trump’s new favorite general</a></li>\n</ul><h1></h1>\n<p><strong>Here are three new stories from <i>The Atlantic</i>:</strong></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-powell-federal-reserve/683621/?utm_source=feed\">What Trump’s feud with Jerome Powell is really about</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/trump-weird-posts-truth-social-epstein/683627/?utm_source=feed\">Trump’s social-media habit is getting weirder.</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-border-patrol-gregory-bovino/683617/?utm_source=feed\">The hype man of Trump’s mass deportations</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Today’s News</strong></p><ol>\n\t<li>House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/politics/epstein-files-house-vote-gop-johnson-massie\">blocked a potential floor vote</a> on the release of additional files in the Jeffrey Epstein case until at least September.</li>\n\t<li>The Trump administration released <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/22/us/mlk-files-released-what-we-know\">more than 240,000 pages</a> of long-sealed FBI files on Martin Luther King Jr. last night, prompting <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-releases-fbi-records-mlk-jrs-assassination/story?id=123938278\">warnings from his family</a> about the potential misuse of surveillance records to distort his legacy.</li>\n\t<li>President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/marcos-trump-philippines-china-tariffs-3138d1d7f8368c022ab9242bebb4a2e2\">met with Philippine President</a> Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House and agreed to a trade deal that imposes a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/22/us-philippines-trade-deal-trump-tariffs\">19 percent tariff on goods from the Philippines</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Evening Read</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"Photo of a narrow street in Corfu’s Old Town, with laundry hanging from above.\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/2025/07/Corfu_Lead/original.jpg\" width=\"3000\">\n\nA narrow street in Corfu’s Old Town Alice Zoo for The Atlantic\n<p>Chasing le Carré in Corfu</p><p><i>By Honor Jones</i></p><blockquote>\n<p>Black dress, pink coat, thick beige stockings.

He demanded that the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians revert to their original names (the Redskins and Indians, respectively), and posted an AI-generated video of Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office set to the song “Y.M.C.A.,” by the Village People. Trump also shared a contextless, grainy video that looks like it was scraped from some viral social-media post. It includes no captions and features <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114887999995033128\">25 stitched-together clips</a>, set to music, of people doing wild or dangerous stunts: A woman appears to catch a charging cobra with her bare hands, a man does a forward flip from one moving skateboard to another, various people contort their bodies in strange ways, a dude stands on the footrests of a moving dirt bike.</p><p></p><p>Even some of Trump’s die-hard fans on Truth Social seemed caught off guard by the video, struggling to draw a connection between it and Trump’s politics. “Was expecting a video of you at the end!” one top commenter <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@CarmelRae/114888397557947849\">wrote</a>. (A spokesperson for the White House did not answer my questions about why the commander in chief was posting an extreme-sports highlight reel on Sunday night.)</p><p></p><p>The bizarre video was immediately recognizable to me as the type of garbage that clogs the feeds of many people who still use Facebook, a platform that is filled with inscrutable slop posted by spammers and content farmers. By the early 2020s—before generative-AI images <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/06/hot-jesus-ai/678814/?utm_source=feed\">took over</a>—Facebook had already transformed into a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/11/facebooks-vast-wasteland/676883/?utm_source=feed\">vast wasteland</a> of low-quality memes, repurposed videos, and strange pages dedicated to clips like “Shelter Pit Bull Made His Bed Every Day Until a Family Adopted Him.” This type of content fits in a category that I have taken to calling “soft-brain scrolling.” It falls somewhere between probably harmless and not nutritious; it’s mostly low-quality algorithmic arbitrage that <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/facebooks-algorithm-is-boosting-ai-spam-that-links-to-ai-generated-ad-laden-click-farms/\">helps click farmers make a buck</a>. Your confused relatives seem to love it.</p><p></p><p>That the account belonging to the president of the United States is now posting to the entire world like a Facebook Uncle, though, is a troubling sign. (It’s unclear if Trump does all of the direct publishing himself, though <em>The Washington Post </em>reported last month that aides have been surprised by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/06/03/trump-truth-social-twitter/\">messages posted to his account</a> in the wee hours of the morning. In the past, he would <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68987594\">reportedly dictate and edit his own tweets</a>, down to the odd capitalization of specific words.) He’s exhibited milder forms of Facebook Uncle syndrome for years now—even in 2016, Trump would <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/01/donald-trump-mostly-retweets-white-supremacists.html\">retweet</a> white-supremacist accounts, <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/805278955150471168\">angrily</a> live-tweet <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and publicly <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/813945096269860866\">congratulate</a> himself—but the behavior appears to be getting worse.</p><p></p><p>The best analogue for this moment may be Trump’s online raging after the January 6, 2021, insurrection. During this period, Trump was temporarily banned from mainstream platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. He launched Truth Social in 2022 and began making and sharing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/us/politics/trump-social-media-extremism.html\">more extreme posts</a>, including hundreds from accounts promoting QAnon conspiracy theories. In one day in 2022, he reportedly posted 50 separate times—in many cases about how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen. The tone this past weekend felt similar, with Trump posting an AI-generated image of officials from the Obama administration and former FBI Director James Comey in orange prison jumpsuits, arrayed in a <em>Brady Bunch–</em>style grid. The center of the image <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114888263063561606\">reads</a> “The Shady Bunch.” Along the same lines, Trump also posted a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114863203348237352\">caps-laden message to his followers last week</a>, demanding that they move on from the Epstein “Hoax” and calling it “bullshit” from the “Lunatic Left.” He is lashing out, on the defensive, and seemingly unable, or at best unwilling, to control his screen time.</p><p></p><p>Trump has always loved to post, obviously, and even the generative-AI stuff isn’t new, exactly. Last year, during his presidential campaign, Trump fully embraced<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/trump-posts-ai-image/679540/?utm_source=feed\"> the technology as a propaganda tool</a>, posting and reposting images of himself praying, Taylor Swift fans endorsing him en masse (that was before the real Taylor Swift endorsed his opponent), and AI Kamala Harris speaking in front of a hammer and sickle flag. As the <em>Post </em>reported in its article about Trump’s social-media use, in the first four and a half months of this term, Trump “posted to Truth Social over 2,200 times—more than three times the number of tweets he sent in the same period in 2017.”</p><p></p><p>Unlike the material we saw over the weekend, a lot of Trump’s posts during that period were clear political statements and directives. During Trump’s tariff vacillations, which caused markets to plummet, he posted on Truth Social that Americans should “BE COOL” and not become “PANICANS,” an invented term for people who expressed genuine concern that Trump was destroying the economy. (MAGA influencers tried and failed to make that one stick.) Trump also used his account to threaten world leaders. For instance, he lashed out at Colombian President Gustavo Petro over his attempts to block deportation flights. (Petro<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p36e62gyo\"> backed down</a>.) In May, he used the account to admonish Russian President Vladimir Putin,<a href=\"https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/31265\"> suggesting</a> that “if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia,” and that Putin was “playing with fire!” His posting in the lead-up to bombing Iran was another example of Trump forcing the world to hang on his every word; eventually, he announced the strike via Truth Social. In all cases, Trump was posting, however maniacally, from a position of power and demonstrating influence.</p><p></p><p>Not so recently. The week that preceded the Truth Social binge on Sunday may very well have been the most frustrating of Trump’s second term, not only because the Epstein scandal threatened to tear apart his MAGA coalition, but because Trump could not persuade the usual people to drop the story. As my colleagues Ashley Parker and Jonathan Lemire<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/inside-white-house-trump-epstein-strategy/683604/?utm_source=feed\"> reported over the weekend</a>, “the limits of his power over normal allies became evident” as Trump failed to get Rupert Murdoch or <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s editor in chief, Emma Tucker, to stop the paper from publishing a story about a<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796\"> lewd 50th-birthday letter</a> that Trump allegedly sent to Epstein.</p><p></p><p>Trump had to deal with frustrations like these during his first term, when he was often checked and handled by career politicians and beset by press leaks from anonymous staffers, and faced constant backlash from the media and Silicon Valley. But Trump’s second term has been different. He’s surrounded mostly by true believers and sycophants and able to engage somewhat freely in<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/american-panopticon/682616/?utm_source=feed\"> various forms of government dismantling and corruption</a>. Numerous media companies have<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5454790/cbs-settlement-trump-60-minutes-harris-interview-analysis\"> bowed</a> to Trump or appeared to<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y44gw5gpro\"> soften</a> their adversarial stance. At Trump’s inauguration,<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/trump-musk-zuckerberg-silicon-valley-kisses-the-ring/681384/?utm_source=feed\"> Silicon Valley’s most powerful executives stood behind him</a>, offering a tacit show of support for his administration. The vibe had shifted in Trump’s favor, and he behaved with impunity. Yet the Epstein case has been a genuine hurdle. Republicans are seemingly desperate to make the story go away, so much so that Speaker Mike Johnson<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/22/us/trump-news?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=bsky-nytimes\"> shut the House down</a> early to avoid “political games” and block any potential votes calling for the release of files pertaining to Epstein.</p><p></p><p>One can tell a lot about how Trump feels about his own power and influence by the way he’s posting. There are multiple ways to interpret Trump’s weekend posts. The most basic is that Trump’s long-standing obsession with AI slop and memes—working in overdrive right now—is a useful propaganda tool. Before he needed a grassroots meme army to provide memes; now polished and bespoke Trump slop is always just a ChatGPT query away, no genuine enthusiasm required.</p><p></p><p>A second reading is to see Trump’s affinity for reposting fan art as Executive Cope. Here, the slop is a way for Trump to escape and imagine the world as he’d like it to be. In slop world, Trump is not embattled, getting screamed at by his supporters over what looks to them like a guilty cover-up on behalf of a pedophile. Instead, he’s arresting Obama. It’s pure fan fiction that depicts Trump having power in a moment when, perhaps, he feels somewhat powerless.</p><p></p><p>A third reading of Trump’s Truth Social posts—especially his reposting of strange viral Facebook garbage and angry culture-war stuff railing against “woke” sports-team names—suggests that these posts aren’t part of any kind of strategy or coping mechanism, but examples of a person who is addled and raging at things he feels he has no control over. For years, people have offered anecdotes that Trump behaves online like some isolated, elderly people who have been radicalized by their social-media feeds—in 2017, Stephen Colbert <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVGsb5kjXlQ\">memorably</a> likened Trump to America’s first racist grandpa. His recent posting certainly fits this template. And paired with some of Trump’s other cognitive stumbles—<a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-was-surprised-jerome-powell-fed-chair-appointed-was-appoint-rcna219162\">he seemingly forgot last week that he had appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell</a>—it all starts to feel more concerning.</p><p></p><p>In this context, Trump’s Truth Social page is little more than a rapid-response account that illustrates a world that doesn’t actually exist: one in which POTUS looks like a comic-book hero, is universally beloved, and exerts his executive authority to jail or silence anyone who disagrees with him. This sort of revenge fantasy would be sad coming from anyone. That it is coming from the president of the United States, a man obsessed with retribution, who presides over a government that is enthusiastically arresting and jailing immigrants in makeshift camps, is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>All of this points to what my colleague Tom Nichols <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/07/a-searing-reminder-that-trump-is-unwell/679170/?utm_source=feed\">noted</a> almost exactly one year ago, when Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination: The president “is emotionally unwell.” In describing Trump’s speech that night, Nichols said that his long, often pointless digressions “were the ramblings of a man who has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/?utm_source=feed\">serious psychological problems</a>. All of it was on display last night: rage, paranoia, pettiness, desolating selfishness.”</p><p></p><p>The same explanation could be applied perfectly to Trump’s Truth Social posts over the weekend. Trump called for Senator Adam Schiff to be prosecuted. He appeared pathologically aggrieved—spending part of his Saturday night <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/retconning--russiagate\">posting</a> a detailed infographic intended to debunk the supposed “Russia hoax” from an election that happened almost nine years ago. (Propaganda experts <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/retconning--russiagate\">say</a> this is an attempt by Trump and his administration to rewrite history.) He posted a fake mug shot of Obama. And, on Sunday morning, he pecked out a 103-word <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114885422115933668\">message</a> congratulating himself on his first six months in office. Rage, paranoia, pettiness, and desolating selfishness: Trump appears consumed more and more by an online world that offers him the chance to live out the fantasy of the unilateral power and adulation that he craves.</p><p></p><p>Talking about Trump and social media is complicated because, unlike most users, Trump <em>can</em> post ridiculous things, transform news cycles, and force the world to react to his posts. But lately, his posts are not having the desired effect. It’s possible that what observers witnessed this weekend is a tipping point of sorts. Trump’s posts, instead of influencing reality, suggest that the president is retreating from it entirely.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Every so often, Donald Trump sends an encouraging signal to Ukraine, despite his long pattern of deference toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last week, the president of the United States allowed the transfer of a number of American Patriot anti-missile systems through Germany—a move that will strengthen Ukraine’s air defense at a dangerous time. The Ukrainians are so pleased with this offer that President Volodymyr Zelensky <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/07/17/us-news/trump-zelensky-discuss-drone-mega-deal-for-us-to-buy-battle-ready-ukraine-uavs/\">has floated</a> an expanded military relationship, wherein Ukraine would share its drone expertise with Americans in exchange for further arms sales.</p><p>Then again, Ukrainian air defenses are overstretched in part because of another recent decision Trump made: As he was agreeing last week to allow the transfer of more Patriots to Ukraine—at Europe’s expense—he also gave Putin about 50 days to come to the negotiating table before the White House will consider new sanctions against Russia. In essence, Trump gave the Russian dictator the rest of the summer to continue his bombing campaign against Ukrainian cities.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/06/ukraine-new-war-drone-strike/683008/?utm_source=feed\">Phillips Payson O’Brien: Ukraine’s warning to the world’s other military forces</a>]</i></p><p>Recognizing that supporting a democratic Ukraine against Putin’s invasion is in America’s interest, the Biden administration had donated weapons to Ukraine, rather than expecting to be paid for them. Ukraine, which needs supplies to continue its fight, has no real choice but to keep seeking the White House’s favor. But Trump seems to be stringing the Ukrainians along. The equipment he plans to furnish will not be enough to enable the Ukrainians to win. Whatever help he provides appears less decisive than the obstacles he puts in their way.</p><p>For months now, the Russians have spurned any real negotiations with Ukraine and ramped up their bombardment of Ukrainian cities—killing and maiming civilians on almost a nightly basis. In response to this, Trump has regularly decried Putin’s actions, but resolutely refused to take any concrete steps himself to rein the Russian dictator in.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/thomas-wright/?utm_source=feed\">Thomas Wright</a>]</i><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/trump-ukraine-policy-putin-battlefield/683535/?utm_source=feed\">: Putin needs to believe he can’t win</a></p><p>As Russia launched an ever-larger number of missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, many in Congress were eager to approve crippling secondary sanctions that would have all but prevented outside powers from doing business with Russia. These measures were included in a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal—and co-sponsored by more than 80 other members of the senior chamber. It was also a bill that stood to gain quick passage in the House—if Trump would allow House Speaker Mike Johnson bring it to a vote. Trump even indicated that his wife, Melania, was appalled at the destruction that Ukrainians keep suffering. “I go home. I tell the first lady, ‘You know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said, ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,’” Trump said last week.</p><p>But instead of moving firmly against Putin, Trump gave his 50-day ultimatum—which may not even be an ultimatum if, in the end, Trump backs off his threat to impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia. As nationalist commentators in Russia quickly understood, Trump was offering Putin a great strategic gift. In part because Trump has refused to add new sanctions after his inauguration in January, and suppliers have found ways around existing ones, Russia can now manufacture more missiles. After dark, Russian forces are bombarding Ukrainian cities with a growing number of missiles and drones—the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-putin-attacks-0a06736dea37114aa0f351d21746912b\">record for one night</a>, set earlier this month, is more than 700, a quantity that would have been inconceivable in 2022, at the start of the full-scale invasion. And German General Christian Freuding, head of the Ukraine Situational Center at the German Ministry of Defense, recently said that Russia <a href=\"https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/germany-warns-russia-could-unleash-2-000-1752987508.html\">wants to be able to launch 2,000 drones</a> in a single attack.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/nataliya-gumenyuk/?utm_source=feed\">Nataliya Gumenyuk</a>]</i><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/05/ukraine-troops-front-lines/682910/?utm_source=feed\">: Ukraine’s new way of war</a></p><p>Even if Ukraine gains access to greater defensive firepower, the country almost certainly won’t be able to shoot down all of the incoming munitions in attacks of that size, and the toll in Ukrainian lives seems sure to mount.</p><p>On the ground, Russia can step up its efforts to take one tiny parcel of Ukrainian land after the next—even at the cost of sending tens of thousands more of its own soldiers to their doom. If Trump genuinely has plans to increase pressure on Russia after his 50-day grace period expires, he’s essentially giving Putin reason to set a goal of conquering as much territory as possible before coming to any peace talks.</p><p>At the end of a 50-day rampage, the Russians could even decide to take up the terrible “peace” deal that the Trump administration floated a few months ago. This included letting the Russians keep almost every piece of Ukrainian land they have seized, granting U.S. recognition of Russian control over Crimea, depriving Ukraine of any hope of NATO membership, and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas\">withholding any meaningful security guarantees</a> whatsoever.</p><p>Having done everything Trump has asked, having negotiated in good faith, having kissed up to the president, having avoided attacking Russian civilian targets partially out of deference to the U.S., the Ukrainians now see the White House basically guaranteeing the Russians a sanctions-free summer to commit any atrocities they want.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Zelensky’s offer to share drone expertise is a gamble, given Trump’s apparent sympathy for Putin. Hoping to entice his American counterpart into providing reliable support, the Ukrainian leader previously offered the United States an interest in his country’s mineral wealth. The deal is in effect, but Trump’s support remains fickle at best, because supporting a free people in their struggle against a foreign dictatorship is no longer a priority for the United States.</p>",

Every Tuesday, James Parker tackles readers’ questions.

Candidly, I’m not a great athlete, but I’ve always been enthusiastic. Now, in my late 50s, I’ve gotten especially serious about tennis. Sometimes, I play five times a week. I’ve committed to improving and have taken group and individual lessons. I play in competitive United States Tennis Association leagues specific to my age and ability, and play pickup games whenever I can.</p><p>But I realize that when I play competitively, I have a negative, lingering, outsize reaction to losing. When I lose, I try to reframe it less as a defeat and more as <em>What did I learn today?</em> Yet my mind leads me back to despair and rumination on my mistakes.</p><p>Logically, I know that if I were to win these competitions, I would most likely be bumped up to the next level. And at that point, I would probably be the weakest player in a higher level of competition—leading right back, with even more frequency, to despair. Some athletes joyfully stick with their sports for a lifetime and don’t seem to be derailed by losing. What am I missing? How can I develop a healthier relationship to defeat?</p>\n<p><strong>Dear Reader,</strong></p><p>I don’t think you’re missing anything. We all lose in the end—that’s the second law of thermodynamics. And every intervening loss, be it in business, love, or tennis, simply reminds us of this elemental fact. Is it even possible to have a healthy relationship with losing? I’m not sure it is, any more than it’s possible to have a healthy relationship with food poisoning. Certain human experiences simply resist philosophy.</p><p>My grandfather, who had an ego like a piece of Roman statuary, enjoyed a game of chess. Especially in his final years: late-night, booze-fueled and booze-fuddled, with the occasional, accidental knocking-over of pieces. He enjoyed it—if he won. If he didn’t win, he would take it as a melancholy comment on his old age, as evidence that his mind was going at last. And then he would slump, and brood loudly upon his failing faculties. So, as his opponent, you had to lose. But you couldn’t lose too easily or obviously; fuzzy as he was, he would pick up on that. You had to lose while looking as if you were trying to win. (It often fell to my brother, a teenager at the time and—luckily for my grandfather—an excellent chess player, to perform this complex operation.)</p><p>What’s my point? Good question. I think my point is that losing is never just losing. In your case, losing at tennis connects to what? An ever-present and not particularly welcome sense of your limitations as a player? A whisper of advancing decrepitude? Some other, deeper, darker thing? When I lose, I feel like the cosmos is against me. And I’m right.</p><p>So forget about being a good loser. Work on the comeback: That’s my advice. Doomed as we may be to entropy, we humans also possess nearly idiotic capacities for self-renewal. We bounce back! Soak up the gall of losing, absorb the horrible information, feel it to the full, go there—and then rebound, with superb elasticity. Save your energy for that.</p><p>Anticipating a National Magazine Award for this column,</p><p>James</p>\n<p><em>By submitting a letter, you are agreeing to let </em>The Atlantic<em> use it in part or in full, and we may edit it for length and/or clarity.</em></p>",

We’re in a golden age of comedy now where everyone can say exactly what they want, free of the fear of censorship, except by the government. Donald Trump has made comedy legal again!</p><p>  Remember, censorship is when people don’t laugh at your jokes. Freedom is when your <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/colbert-ouster-cbc-trump/683593/?utm_source=feed\">late-night show</a> gets permanently taken off the air for financial reasons (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/paramount-agrees-pay-16-million-settle-trumps-lawsuit-60-minutes-kamal-rcna216419\">16 million of them</a>) and the president expresses his approval. Comedy is great again, which is to say, it’s funny only if the president says so. Jokes are back, baby! Airplane travel is the worst! Take my wife, please. She’s a green-card holder who’s been in the country for 25 years! Knock, knock! Who’s there? Sorry, they won’t identify themselves, but they say they’re here about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5393055/tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-ordered-freed-from-immigration-detention\">the op-ed</a>.</p><p>  The Norwegian tourist who was denied entry by border officers—after the agents took a special interest in <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2025/06/24/european-tourist-denied-entry-to-us-over-jd-vance-meme-on-his-phone.html\">the meme of J. D. Vance he had on his phone</a>—didn’t understand that when we say that comedy is legal again, we mean <i>real </i>comedy. This was clearly not comedy. This was somebody laughing at J. D. Vance. Comedy is when you laugh <i>with</i> J. D. Vance about people who don’t look to him like their ancestors <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/americans-civil-war-ancestors-greater-195139738.html\">fought in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War</a>. Comedy is the memes that the Department of Homeland Security and the White House keep sharing about how Donald Trump is Superman and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DL50liop_VC/\">“my body is a machine that turns ICE funding into mass deportations”</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/dhsgov/status/1945606217637732821?s=46&amp;t=Qvvpx1y3ZVoWuipFiGFQRQ\">“even E.T. knew when it was time to GO HOME”</a>!</p><p>If you need any more clarity about what comedy is, here’s one of <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376\">Trump’s favorite comedians </a>(“I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined.”) offering what has been identified as a joke: “You know what?” <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/fox-news-greg-gutfeld-wants-133229011.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACknx4Ke_7664DVC2cpD_H9GF4t2ZiZWhhHMr0iUiClIfT2AvjATbUa5cgxHaD_qsTr3pspMw1DCNuX6E5xg8BwtKTunNIQOOyxz8TfWuFxY1iWWLclhbz8gmVigyX5VJCw6AfVfcmhTStusaVOj12mgczmIWwL0SObqaMynjCWY&amp;guccounter=2\">Gutfeld</a> said on Fox News. “I’ve said this before: We need to learn from the Blacks, the way they were able to remove the power from the N-word by using it. So from now on, it’s ‘What up, my Nazi?’ ‘Hey, what up, my Nazi?’ Hey, what’s hanging, my Nazi?’”</p><p>Laugh? I thought I’d die! This joke is funny, because people are constantly saying that Gutfeld is a Nazi, and he is getting a little sick of it. So, to dodge the Nazi allegations, he’s riffing on the N-word! This is comedy now!</p><p>Comedy is legal again. You are free to say whatever you want, provided it’s a slur. You must say it, or President Trump won’t approve your <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-washington-commanders-change-back-to-former-name/\">new stadium</a>! No, that’s not a joke. That’s completely serious.</p><p>You should know by now: Everything is serious, until it’s suddenly a joke and you were a fool for not laughing. Everything is a joke, until suddenly it’s serious and <i>how dare you laugh</i>. Everyone is trolling, until they aren’t, and even when they aren’t, they are. Everyone is always and never joking. It’s not a threat. It’s a joke. Comedy is legal again!</p>\n<p>Tragedy, to paraphrase Mel Brooks, is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die. More and more people are getting pushed into open sewers lately. Boom times for comedy. Boom times for laughing <i>at</i>. From the open sewer, you can hear a lot of laughing.</p><p>They are so glad not to have to remember anymore that other people are in the room. What an enormous relief! Finally, they can <i>say </i>it! That is the project of Trumpism: becoming the only people in the room again. Becoming both the protagonists and the intended audience, the only people whose laughter counts.</p><p>What you think is funny depends on what you believe to be true. When you make a joke, you are asking someone to look at something and see the same thing you see. When the response is laughter, it is a way of making eye contact, of looking through the world at one another. That is the terror of bombing onstage: the realization that what you are seeing is not what everyone else is seeing. The anxiety that you have got the world by the wrong end, that you are alone in what you think.</p><p>But there are two reasons you can laugh. One is recognition, and the other is coercion. Some jokes are funny only with a power differential to back them up. This is the kind of comedy that’s legal now: the joke whose punch line you’re afraid to be. The kind of joke you have to take. Laugh, so they’ll know you’re one of them. Laugh, or he’ll kill you. Laugh, and maybe you won’t be next.</p>",
