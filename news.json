    "content": "<p>Yesterday evening, Sam Altman shared an image of the Death Star on X. There was no caption on the picture, which showed the world-destroying <em>Star Wars </em>space station rising over an Earth-like planet, but his audience understood the context. In fewer than 24 hours, OpenAI would release an AI model intended to wipe out all the rest.</p><p></p><p>That model, GPT-5, launched earlier today with all the requisite fanfare. In an announcement video, Altman said that the product will serve as a “legitimate Ph.D.-level expert in anything—any area you need, on demand—that can help you with whatever your goals are.” He added that “anyone, pretty soon, will be able to do more than anyone in history could.” In more concrete terms, GPT-5 is an upgrade to the ChatGPT interface you’re likely already familiar with: a model that’s now a bit better at writing, coding, math and science problems, and the like.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Altman has a penchant for hyperbole, and OpenAI—like the rest of the AI industry—likes to tout each new model as the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/chatbots-benchmark-tests/681929/?utm_source=feed\">best ever</a>. But this particular release feels notable for a few reasons. First, it has been a long wait since the release of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/gpt4-release-rumors-hype-future-iterations/673396/?utm_source=feed\">GPT-4</a> in March 2023, just a few months after ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022. And second, in that time, OpenAI has become a bona fide tech empire: As of this week, OpenAI now provides enterprise ChatGPT accounts to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-is-giving-chatgpt-federal-workers/\">federal agencies at essentially no cost</a>; its products are also used by <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/29/openai-chatgpt-200-million-weekly-active-users\">nearly every</a> Fortune 500 company; and today Altman announced that roughly 700 million people worldwide use ChatGPT every week. In terms of sheer reach, this is the company’s most consequential product announcement ever.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/06/everything-app-big-tech-ai-endgame/683024/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Big Tech’s AI endgame is coming into focus</a>]</i></p><p>As OpenAI has ascended to the scale of a typical tech giant—it is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-eyes-500-billion-valuation-potential-employee-share-sale-source-says-2025-08-06/\">reportedly</a> in talks for a $500 billion valuation—the firm has also started to act like its corporate rivals. To attract new users and customers (and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/openai-lock-in-profit/682538/?utm_source=feed\">keep existing ones from turning to other AI products</a>), OpenAI has doubled down on institutional partnerships and polishing its product lineup. Sure, the company still pushes the limits of AI capabilities, but its products are what keep most consumers and businesses coming back for more. For instance, OpenAI has partnered with Bain &amp; Company, Mattel, Moderna, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Harvard. It has brought on Jony Ive, the designer of the iPhone, to spearhead the creation of physical OpenAI devices. (<em>The Atlantic</em> and OpenAI have a corporate partnership.)</p><p></p><p>GPT-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of AI benchmarks, according to OpenAI’s internal tests, but it is far from a clean sweep: On a few tests, competing products such as Google Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and xAI’s Grok outperform, or are just barely below the level of, OpenAI’s new top model. The GPT-5 announcement video and launch page also contained a number of errors—incorrect labels, numbers and colors that made no sense, and missing entries on charts—that made the program’s precise abilities, and the trustworthiness of OpenAI’s reporting, hard to discern (and led some observers to joke that perhaps GPT-5 itself had made, or hallucinated, the graphics). Yet that may not matter. OpenAI’s animating theme for GPT-5 is user experience, not “intelligence”: Its new model is intuitive, fast, and efficient; adapts to human preferences and intentions; and is easy to personalize. Before it is more intelligent, GPT-5 is more <em>usable</em>—and more likely to attract and retain users. “The important point is this,” Altman said, pinching a thumb and index finger together for emphasis: “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous AI.”</p><p></p><p>In some sense, OpenAI is learning from its greatest success. ChatGPT took off because it effectively redesigned an existing product: GPT-3.5, ChatGPT’s original underlying model, was months old by the time the chatbot came out, but it was relatively obscure. Placing essentially the same program within a conversational interface, however, made the model easy to use and obsess over. GPT-4 would eventually provide a new engine—smarter and more capable—but this was almost beside the point; to most people, the product was already firmly established as ChatGPT. And, like the original ChatGPT, GPT-5 is free, although nonpaying users have a limit on their usage of this most-advanced model—giving everyone a small taste of OpenAI’s ecosystem to open up the possibility that they will want, and pay for, more.</p><p></p><p>During the ensuing two-plus years of the AI race, OpenAI has kept up by releasing a slew of more minor models and new features. When Google released a version of Gemini that was extremely fast and cheap, OpenAI did the same; when <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/deepseek-china-ai/681481/?utm_source=feed\">DeepSeek</a> launched a free and advanced model that could “reason” through complex questions, OpenAI publicly released a still more powerful reasoning system of its own; as Anthropic’s Claude Code seemed to corner the AI-coding market, OpenAI came out with the Codex tool for software engineers. The empire’s ambitions had no limits.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/deepseek-china-ai/681481/?utm_source=feed\">Read: China’s DeepSeek surprise</a>]</i></p><p>But these products were accompanied by a labyrinth of names and uses: GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini and GPT-4.1; o1-mini and o1-pro; o3 and o3-pro and o4-mini; and so on. This was a matter not only of poor branding but of poor design. Despite the numbers, for some uses o3 is better than o4. Users frequently complain that they don’t know how to select from OpenAI’s models. “We are near the end of this current problem,” Altman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9mjd-65gw\">said</a> on OpenAI’s podcast in June. “I am excited to just get to GPT-5 and GPT-6, and I think that’ll be easier for people to use.”</p><p></p><p>Now OpenAI has arrived at GPT-5, and indeed, the model might be best understood as providing easier and frictionless use—an amalgam of all of OpenAI’s disparate, discrete advances from the previous two-plus years. GPT-5 “eliminates this choice” among models and their specialties, Mark Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer, said in today’s announcement, and that may be the new model’s core feature. GPT-5 modulates its approach to your query, using more or less “reasoning” power—doing the equivalent of selecting among the GPT-4os and o3s and o4s—depending on what is asked of it. OpenAI is now <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes\">retiring</a> a large number of its previous major models.</p><p></p><p>Alongside GPT-5, OpenAI also announced a number of other additions to the ChatGPT experience to “make ChatGPT more personalized,” Chen said, “so it’s more like your AI.” These new features are customizable color schemes, personalities (“cynic,” “robot,” “listener,” “nerd”), and access to Gmail and Google Calendar—all building on top of the recently added “Memories” feature, through which ChatGPT can pull information from previous chats. These add-ons have little to do with the bot’s engine—how “intelligent” or “capable” it is—but they will make ChatGPT more individualized, more useful, and perhaps more fun. Businesses can integrate their data as well. Just as the years of photos and notes on your iPhone make switching to a Google Pixel undesirable, or years of using Google Drive make migrating to Microsoft OneDrive hard, if ChatGPT morphs from a vanilla bot into <em>your</em> AI or your company’s AI, leaving for Gemini or Claude becomes not just burdensome but a downgrade.</p><p></p><p>At this stage of the AI boom, when every major chatbot is legitimately helpful in numerous ways, benchmarks, science, and rigor feel almost insignificant. What matters is how the chatbot <em>feels</em>—and, in the case of the Google integrations, that it can span your entire digital life. Before OpenAI builds artificial general intelligence—a model that can do basically any knowledge work as well as a human, and the first step, in the company’s narrative, toward overhauling the economy and curing all disease—it is aiming to build an artificial general assistant. This is a model that aims to do everything, fit for a company that wants to be everywhere.</p>",

Democrats hope to deprive the legislature of quorum, thus blocking the passage of any new map.</p><p>Traditionally, states redistrict after the decennial Census, and those maps endure for a decade, unless courts order changes, as they sometimes do. Texas’s current maps were drawn by Republicans, and in the most recent election, they produced 25 GOP seats and 13 Democratic ones. That’s 66 percent of districts with 58 percent of the total House vote for Republicans—not bad. But under pressure from the White House, Texas Republicans are now trying to squeeze out a little more juice.</p><p>The attempt to redistrict is an unusual, brazen, and questionable move, though not entirely without precedent. In 2003, Texas Republicans redrew maps so as to give themselves a majority of the state’s House seats. Democrats, dubbed the <a href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/election/2020/10/06/a-brief-history-of-texas-gerrymandering-\">“Killer Ds,”</a> fled the state to prevent a quorum. They were initially successful, but a later attempt to prevent a quorum failed when a member broke ranks, and a new map passed. Texas Democrats are hoping they can learn the lessons of that attempt and win this time. They have a strategy, they have support from governors out of state, and, as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/04/greg-abbott-texas-democrats-redistricting-00492100\"><i>Politico</i></a><i> </i>notes, they have the chance to run out the clock on a new map before a December deadline.</p><p>Still, if Democrats had any better options, they’d take them. Maintaining caucus discipline for the next four months will be no easy task. And that’s assuming some of the more draconian ideas offered to break them fail. State Attorney General <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/05/paxton-removing-dems-00494730\">Ken Paxton</a> wants to have the Democrats removed from office for their absence. (Experts say this is <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/05/texas-democrats-ken-paxton-court-vacate-seats-quorum-break/\">legally dubious</a>, and the idea of Paxton enforcing rectitude and duty is <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-ken-paxton-hopes-parlay-multiple-scandals-gop-senate-campaign-rcna200385\">grimly hilarious</a>.) U.S. Senator <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/07/fbi-texas-democrats-illinois-cornyn-redistricting\">John Cornyn</a>, whose reelection hopes are teetering precariously in a GOP primary against Paxton, tried to one-up that by requesting that the FBI help locate the Democratic fugitives. (Never mind that they haven’t obviously committed any crimes.)</p><p>All things being equal, legislators skipping sessions to prevent a state government from accomplishing business isn’t a good thing. Oregon Democrats were so sick of state GOP legislators doing so that they enacted a law blocking chronic absentees from running for reelection in the next term. Then again, opportunistic mid-decade redistricting isn’t a good thing, either. Gerrymanders produce worse governance because they are less representative; they also feed polarization by making elected officials dependent less on the general electorate and more on primary voters.</p><p>And what’s happening in Texas <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/07/texas-gerrymandering-districts-house-congress/683716/?utm_source=feed\">has already spread further</a>. As soon as Republicans began talking about a Texas redistricting effort, Democrats in states including California and New York threatened to redraw maps to retaliate and push out Republicans. Now the GOP is looking at other red states, including <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/08/06/red-state-green-light-00495062\">Indiana and Missouri</a>, to gain more seats. This is a disheartening example of what I’ve called <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/tennessee-house-expel-democrats-greg-abbott-pardon/673734/?utm_source=feed\">total politics</a>, in which officials try to use every legal tool to gain any advantage, no matter the long-term consequences. In this worldview, what matters is what’s possible, not what’s wise.</p><p>How successful these efforts outside Texas will be is not clear. Hoosier State Republicans appear <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/07/30/the-redistricting-arms-race-00483078\">unenthusiastic</a> about redistricting, though the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-indiana-redistricting-donald-trump-fafc5bd34f741b3886913e792ab33048\">White House</a> seems to believe it can twist their arm. Democrats, meanwhile, have challenges of their own. By some measures, the U.S.House map over the past two elections has had a <a href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=151403\">slight Democratic advantage</a>.</p><p>Moreover, as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/democrats-redistricting-republicans-gerrymandering-texas/683775/?utm_source=feed\">Russell Berman</a> reports, Democrats have spent the past decade pushing good-government reforms such as independent redistricting commissions that are designed to make extreme gerrymandering more difficult. People such as former Attorney General <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/02/us/politics/eric-holder-democrats-gerrymandering.html\">Eric Holder</a>, who has been the leader of Democratic advocacy for fairer districts, are now embracing the tactics they shunned and trying, somewhat painfully, to rationalize them. The explanations really come down to this: Democrats believe that they are losing an existential battle and must do whatever they can.</p><p>But what they can do is limited. Gerrymanders that use race as a basis are unconstitutional, but gerrymanders that use partisanship are not—although, in the South, Democratic affiliation is often a good proxy for Black voters. Chief Justice John Roberts has written that partisan gerrymanders are unfair, but the Supreme Court ruled that it has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/partisan-gerrymandering-supreme-court-north-carolina/592741/?utm_source=feed\">no authority</a> to do anything about them. Roberts recommended that states handle the issue on their own.</p><p>This is where gerrymandering becomes a devilish, self-perpetuating problem. Voters who want to stop gerrymanders at the state level find their path blocked by … gerrymandering. Take North Carolina, which went from a 7–7 split in the U.S. House to a 10–4 GOP edge under a new map enacted ahead of last year’s elections. State legislators have also gerrymandered their own maps, so that although Democrats won narrow majorities of all the votes cast for both the state House and state Senate, they hold only two-fifths of the seats in both chambers.</p><p>For decades, the Voting Rights Act has provided a path by which Black voters are guaranteed representation, through the drawing of majority-minority districts that would be otherwise considered unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. (Texas has one of the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/voting-and-voter-registration-as-a-share-of-the-voter-population-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Percent%20of%20Voter%20Population%20Registered%20to%20Vote%20by%20Race%2FEthnicity__Black%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">highest proportions</a> of Black voters among states.) Yet as the law professor <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/08/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-clarence-thomas-message.html\">Richard Hasen</a> writes in <i>Slate</i>, the Supreme Court now appears to be considering throwing out majority-minority districts as unconstitutional.</p><p>This week marks the 60th anniversary of the VRA, but after years of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/03/voting-rights-act-democracy/617792/?utm_source=feed\">hollowing out</a> by the Roberts Court, the VRA seems to be nearing irrelevance. The Trump administration has indicated that the Justice Department will move away from prosecuting racial discrimination in voting and toward pursuing bogus allegations of <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trump-administrations-campaign-undermine-next-election\">voter fraud</a>, while the Court may soon eliminate the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5482864/scotus-voting-rights-act-8th-circuit-vra\">ability of individuals and outside groups</a> to bring claims under the law.</p><p>President Lyndon B. Johnson, the Texan who signed the VRA into law, once <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-capitol-rotunda-the-signing-the-voting-rights-act\">said</a>, “This right to vote is the basic right without which all others are meaningless.” If the shameless use of total politics to game districts is successful, it threatens to strip the meaning from that right.</p><p><b>Related:</b></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/democrats-redistricting-republicans-gerrymandering-texas/683775/?utm_source=feed\">How Democrats tied their own hands on redistricting</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/07/texas-gerrymandering-districts-house-congress/683716/?utm_source=feed\">Republicans want to redraw America’s political map.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Here are three new stories from <i>The Atlantic</i>:</strong></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/trump-ukraine-gaza-economy/683786/?utm_source=feed\">Jonathan Lemire: Things aren’t going Donald Trump’s way.</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/08/stock-market-theories/683780/?utm_source=feed\">Does the stock market know something we don’t?</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/08/right-wing-israeli-settlers-annex-gaza/683776/?utm_source=feed\">Israel’s settler right is preparing to annex Gaza.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Today’s News</strong></p><ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>President Donald Trump’s new tariff policy took effect at midnight, raising the overall <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/business/economy/trump-tariffs-trade-war.html\">average effective tariff rate</a> to more than 18 percent, the highest since 1934.

I sat by my bedroom windowsill, painting my nails. Junior prom was just hours away. I was 16. My brother, Alex, was 18—just 22 months older than me.</p>\n\n<p>The car accident happened on a highway in upstate New York in the early morning. My brother was driving a group of his college classmates to an ultimate-frisbee tournament. Over time, my family has settled on the theory that he fell asleep at the wheel, though for a while my parents thought it was mechanical failure. They couldn’t bear the alternative. The car flipped, and the roll bar above the driver’s seat broke his neck. Everyone else walked away.</p>\n\n<p>This May marked 33 years after his death. Since it happened, I’ve been thinking in numbers: days, months, eventually years. It’s a compulsion, really, this ongoing tally. My own private math.

So when Trump deemed a query “the nastiest question” he’s ever gotten from a member of the press, it was notable.</p><p>The moment came in May, when CNBC’s Megan Cassella asked Trump about “TACO,” an acronym for “Trump always chickens out.” The phrase had gained popularity in the financial sector as a derisive shorthand for the president’s penchant for backing down from his tariff threats. During an otherwise routine Oval Office event, Trump sputtered angrily at Cassella, claiming that his shifting tariff timelines were “part of negotiations” and admonishing, “Don’t ever say what you said.”</p><p>Trump’s appetite for confrontation is being tested again this week, with the arrival of two of the most important self-imposed deadlines of his second term, related to the tariffs and the conflict in Ukraine. Both present fraught decisions for Trump, and they come at a time when he faces a confluence of crises. A president who, less than a year ago, staged a historic political comeback and moved to quickly <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/06/trump-second-term-comeback/682573/?utm_source=feed\">conquer Washington and the world</a> now confronts more obstacles than at any point since his inauguration. Some of his central campaign promises—that he would end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and boost the economy—are in peril. And for the first time in his 200 days back in office, the White House has begun to worry about members of the president’s own party defying him.</p><p>Tomorrow, the clock runs out on the two-week window that Trump gave Russia to reach a cease-fire with Ukraine. The president has been upset by his inability to end the war. Without an agreement, he has said, he will impose sanctions on Russia. But doing so would represent the first time in his decade in politics that he has truly punished President Vladimir Putin. Trump likewise has grown exasperated with Israel’s prosecution of the war in the Gaza Strip, a conflict that could soon escalate; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu said today that his military plans to fully occupy the famine-plagued Strip.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/putin-trump-russia-ukraine/682848/?utm_source=feed\">Tom Nichols: Putin’s still in charge</a>]</i></p><p>The other deadline is Trump’s latest vow on tariffs, which go into effect today for 60 nations, with rates ranging from 10 to 41 percent. This time, Trump appeared to relish declaring that there would not be another TACO moment, writing on social media last night, “IT’S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!” Since the panic triggered by Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/trump-liberation-day-tariffs-election/682272/?utm_source=feed\">“Liberation Day”</a> tariff announcement in April, Wall Street has learned to shrug off Trump’s scattershot statements. But the economy has shown new signs of weakness, with stubbornly high prices potentially set to rise again because of the tariffs and, most potently, a recent jobs report poor enough that Trump lashed out against the bureaucrat who compiled it; last week, he fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, claiming, without evidence, that the jobs numbers were bogus. That unprecedented act of petulance risks undermining Wall Street’s confidence in the economy and undercutting Trump’s campaign pledge to give the United States another economic “golden age.”</p><p>Those geopolitical and economic headwinds have been joined by forceful political ones. Since going out on August recess, Republican lawmakers have been heckled at town halls while trying to defend the president’s signature legislative accomplishment, the One Big Beautiful Bill. And some of those same Republicans, in a rare act of rebellion, have questioned Trump’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein matter, a scandal that the president, try as he may, simply has been unable to shake.</p><p class=\"dropcap\">T<span class=\"smallcaps\">he mood in the</span> White House has darkened in the past month, as the president’s challenges have grown deeper. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has become intensely frustrating for Trump, two White House officials and a close outside adviser told me. The president had truly believed that his relationship with Putin would bring about a quick end to the conflict. But instead, Putin has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-putin-russia-ukraine/683531/?utm_source=feed\">taken advantage</a> of Trump’s deference to him and has openly defied the president—“embarrassed him,” one of the officials told me—by ignoring his calls for a cease-fire and ratcheting up his strikes on Ukrainian cities. Trump has sharply criticized his Russian counterpart in recent weeks as he’s mulled what to do.</p><p>Yesterday, Trump said that his personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, had a productive meeting with Putin in Moscow, leading the U.S. president to return to his original plan to end the war: a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/trump-russia-ukraine-putin-zelensky/682873/?utm_source=feed\">summit</a>. A third White House official told me that Trump has informed European leaders that he wants to meet with Putin as soon as next week in a new effort to get a cease-fire. A Kremlin spokesperson accepted the White House offer but said its details needed to be finalized. Trump also told European leaders that he would potentially have a subsequent meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but the Kremlin did not immediately agree to that.</p><p>One of the officials told me that Trump is still considering how and whether to directly punish Putin if Moscow doesn’t hit tomorrow’s deadline. The U.S. does little trade with Russia, so direct levies would be useless, and the West Wing is divided as to the merits of slapping secondary sanctions on nations that do business with Moscow. Trump signed off on sanctioning India this week because, the official told me, he was already annoyed at the lack of progress on a trade deal with Delhi. But he is far more leery of sanctioning China—another major economic partner of Russia’s—for fear of upending ongoing trade negotiations with Beijing.</p><p>Witkoff’s visit to Moscow came just days after he had been in Gaza to urge Netanyahu to ease a blockade and allow more aid and food to reach Palestinians. Although Israel agreed this week to allow some more food in, the humanitarian crisis has not abated. Trump, who badly wants the conflict to end, believes that Netanyahu is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-netanyahu-gaza-famine/683720/?utm_source=feed\">prolonging the war</a> and has told advisers that he is wary of Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-expansion-intl\">new push</a> to capture Gaza. Even so, officials told me, Trump is unlikely to break with Netanyahu in any meaningful way.</p><p>Any president, of course, can be vexed by events outside his nation’s borders. Trump’s superpower at home has long been to command intense loyalty from fellow Republicans. Yet that power might be hitting its limit. He was able to pressure the GOP to pass his One Big Beautiful Bill last month, but some Republicans, seeing its shaky poll numbers, have already tried to distance themselves from it; Senator Josh Hawley, for instance, has said he wants to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/us/politics/medicaid-hawley-trump-policy-bill.html\">roll back</a> some of the Medicaid cuts that the bill, which he voted for, included. And lawmakers who are trying to defend the bill are facing voter anger. Representative Mike Flood was loudly heckled by a hostile crowd at a town hall in his Nebraska district on Monday. One of the White House officials told me that the West Wing has told House leadership to advise Republican members against holding too many in-person town halls.</p><p>Then there is Epstein. Trump has desperately wished the story away. He feels <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/inside-white-house-trump-epstein-strategy/683604/?utm_source=feed\">deeply betrayed</a> by his MAGA supporters who believed him when he <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-years-including-2024-campaign-trail/story?id=123778541\">intimated during the campaign</a> that something was nefarious about the government’s handling of the case, and who now have a hard time believing him when he says their suspicions are actually bogus. The president has snapped at reporters asking about Epstein, told House Speaker Mike Johnson to send Congress home early to avoid a vote on whether to release the Epstein files, and sued his on-again, off-again friend Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that Trump had sent Epstein a lewd birthday card in 2003. Murdoch hasn’t backed down. Neither have a number of MAGA luminaries and Republican lawmakers who keep demanding to see the files.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/inside-white-house-trump-epstein-strategy/683604/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Inside the White House’s Epstein strategy</a>]</i></p><p>Trump’s own efforts to manage the story have only fed it. His account of why he and Epstein had a falling-out two decades ago has shifted multiple times. One of the White House officials and the outside ally told me that advisers have told Trump repeatedly to stop saying he has the right to pardon Epstein’s former partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and related offenses, to avoid drawing more attention to his previous friendship with Epstein. Despite hopes that the story would dissipate over the August recess, the White House is preparing for Trump to take more heat from Republicans in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Some Trump allies still believe that the president, even as a lame duck, will keep Republicans in line. “Having survived Russiagate, Hillary Clinton, two impeachments, four trials designed to put him in jail, and two assassination attempts,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told me, “it’s unlikely the current situation will be much of a problem.”</p><p>The White House also pushed back against the idea that Trump is in a perilous moment. “Only the media industrial complex and <a href=\"https://time.com/7303853/trump-insult-panican-term-meaning-white-house-usage/\">panicans</a> would mischaracterize this as a challenging time. They simply haven’t learned anything after covering President Trump for the last 10 years,” the spokesperson Steven Cheung told me in a statement. “The successes of the first 200 days have been unprecedented and exactly what Americans voted for, which is why this country has never been hotter.”</p><p>But others in the party sense signs of trouble. “He’s spending the political capital he’s accumulated for a decade,” Alex Conant, a GOP strategist who worked in President George W. Bush’s White House and on then-Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, told me. “Below the surface of the Republican Party, there’s an intense battle brewing over what a post-Trump GOP looks like. And that surfaces on issues like Israel, the debt, and Epstein. How Trump navigates that fight over the remainder of his presidency will be a big test.”</p><p class=\"dropcap\">T<span class=\"smallcaps\">here was a time</span>, years ago, when August could be counted as a slow news month in Washington. That’s now a distant memory, in no small part because the current president has an insatiable need to be in the news cycle. In August 2017, while Trump was vacationing at his golf club in New Jersey, I asked one of his senior aides why Trump had declared that he would deliver “fire and fury” on North Korea. The aide told me that Trump was looking to intimidate Pyongyang—but that he was also annoyed that he hadn’t been the central storyline on cable news. The bellicose rhetoric worked: Suddenly, Trump had changed the news cycle.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/trump-weird-posts-truth-social-epstein/683627/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The desperation of Donald Trump’s posts</a>]</i></p><p>In this particular summer of his discontent, Trump is again trying to regain control of the political narrative. But his efforts have been more haphazard and less effective: a threat to strip Rosie O’Donnell of her citizenship, a revival of the “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/08/russia-hoax-trump-2016-election/683770/?utm_source=feed\">Russia hoax</a>,” an announcement of a new White House ballroom, even a walk on the West Wing roof. None of those things changed the news cycle; instead, they only reinforced that, at least to some extent, he is at the mercy of events outside his control.</p><p>Trump has long believed that he can create his own truth, often by telling the same falsehood over and over again. He seems to be trying that tactic again too, especially with the economy. Trump’s response to the disastrous July jobs report was to assert, with no evidence, that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had incorrectly reported the statistics to hurt him politically—and then fire the commissioner. That sent a chill through the markets and the business world, which need reliable statistics to function, and sparked fears that Trump will try to bend other government data to his whims.</p><p>When it comes to his own political standing, Trump is also trying to create his own reality, seeming to will away the challenges he faces. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, he insisted that he has “the best poll numbers I’ve ever had,” claiming that his approval was north of 70 percent. But that number represented his approval among <em>Republicans</em>, the interviewer told him. In fact, his overall approval rating is hovering at just about 40 percent. When corrected, all Trump could do was call the whole thing “fake.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Is it Goldstein again?” Richard Nixon demanded.</p><p>In July of 1971, the president was infuriated that an unnamed official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics had seemed to downplay the administration’s progress on reducing unemployment while briefing reporters. His suspicions fell on Harold Goldstein, the longtime civil servant and BLS official in charge of the jobs numbers, who had attracted his ire for other comments earlier in the year. Nixon ordered his political counselor, Charles Colson, to investigate. If it had been Goldstein, he said, “he’s got to be fired.”</p><p>When three hours elapsed without Colson reporting back, the president called Colson twice within the span of two minutes, insisting that Goldstein had to be guilty. “Give Goldstein, the goddamn kike, a polygraph!” he <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-09-24_-_testimony_-_naftali.pdf\">yelled</a> into the phone.</p><p>By the next morning, Nixon’s animus toward Goldstein had hardened into the conviction that the inconvenient numbers from the BLS reflected a problem much larger than one civil servant. He asked his chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, to conduct a review. “I want a look at any sensitive areas around where Jews are involved, Bob,” he <a href=\"https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/white-house-tapes/536/conversation-536-016\">said</a>. “See, the Jews are all through the government, and we have got to get in those areas. We’ve got to get a man in charge who is not Jewish to control the Jewish. Do you understand?” Haldeman affirmed that he did. “The government is full of Jews,” Nixon continued. “Second, most Jews are disloyal.”</p><p>What had started as a fit of pique over jobs numbers was swiftly metastasizing into an extraordinary abuse of presidential power.</p><p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Students and survivors</span> of the Nixon era can be excused for feeling a little déjà vu when they heard the news at the end of last week that President Donald Trump had fired Erika McEntarfer, the BLS commissioner. Trump claimed that the bureau’s latest jobs report was “a scam” that was “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” As the first federal director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, I quickly thought of the summer of 1971.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/07/trump-jerome-powell/683708/?utm_source=feed\">James Surowiecki: What’s holding Trump back from firing Powell</a>]</i></p><p>For most of its history, the BLS has been as professionally obscure as it has been essential. The bureau’s economists produce the respected and strictly nonpartisan numbers that the White House, Congress, investors, and American workers rely on to know how the enormous and complex U.S. economy is doing—and how likely their next wage increase, job opportunity, or pink slip might be. For presidents to be unhappy with the numbers they get from the BLS is commonplace. But it’s not normal for them to take their disappointment or rage out on the economists who compile them.</p><p>In the summer of 1971, Nixon was in the grip of dark conspiratorial thinking. He had been looking forward to positive press from his daughter Tricia’s June White House wedding. Instead, The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers—a classified multivolume compendium of national-security materials pulled together for Lyndon B. Johnson’s secretary of defense Robert McNamara to explain why the United States had gotten into the quagmire of Vietnam. When the former Johnson-era national-security analyst Daniel Ellsberg announced that he was the papers’ leaker, Nixon became convinced that his administration was under assault from smart, well-connected enemies of his Vietnam strategy. So when the BLS official told reporters that a drop in the unemployment rate from 6.2 to 5.6 percent was “a statistical fluke,” Nixon became convinced that Jews within the government were out to sabotage his administration.</p><p>Haldeman, although himself an anti-Semite, worried that Nixon’s rage could cause chaos across the government. He decided to try to satisfy the president by focusing only on the BLS. He asked a White House staffer named Frederic Malek to determine how many Jews were in the BLS, and to recommend what to do with them. Knowing that White House documents should not reflect what this investigation was really about, Malek and his assistant used the code word ethnics in their memos as they counted Jews. In February, during Nixon’s earlier bout of rage, Malek had determined that Goldstein had not acted in a partisan manner. But now, instead of questioning his partisan loyalties, Nixon fixated instead on his faith.</p><p>The president didn’t get all that he wanted. Although Labor Secretary James Hodgson refused to subject Goldstein to a polygraph test, Nixon didn’t fire Hodgson for his defiance. He also didn’t immediately force out the head of the BLS, Geoffrey Moore, who worked for Hodgson. When Malek found that there were 19 “ethnics” among the 52 top officials working at the BLS, Nixon respected the civil-service protections that shielded most of them, including Goldstein, from dismissal. Instead, he had a supervisor placed above Goldstein and removed some of his responsibilities. Peter Henle, another Jewish economist in the bureau, was <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2007/09/nixon-s-jew-count-the-whole-story.html\">transferred</a> out.</p><p>After winning reelection in 1972, Nixon required resignations from all of his political appointees. Nixon ignored most of them, but he accepted Moore’s, and the BLS commissioner left a few months shy of the end of his four-year term in 1973. Moore—who wasn’t even Jewish—was the only person to lose his job because of Nixon’s anti-Semitic paranoia.</p><p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Nixon’s motives were worse</span> than Trump’s. But in most other respects, the events of the past week provide a vivid illustration of how much more dangerous attempts to abuse presidential authority have become.</p><p>Unlike Trump, who lashed out publicly against McEntarfer, Nixon was afraid to own his bad behavior. He did not force out his BLS commissioner in 1971, instead waiting for the chance to accept his resignation two years later. Not wanting his hands to be dirty—as defined by the presidential norms of his era—Nixon constrained himself to abuse power only indirectly. He had no desire to risk public disapproval by firing bureaucrats for specious and explosive reasons.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/richard-nixon-watergate-presidential-immunity/679347/?utm_source=feed\">David Frum: Sorry, Richard Nixon</a>]</i></p><p>Moreover, the Haldeman system for running the White House that Nixon first authorized and then tolerated sought to control an impulsive president, not fully empower him. Nixon lacked perfect instruments to carry out his desires; his environment wasn’t greased for enabling. Although he was clear that he wanted to fire a large number of government workers because of their religious background, he proved unwilling or unable to follow through.</p><p>Trump exhibits no such constraints. The loyal voters who give him his grip on Congress don’t seem to care what norms he violates. Neither Trump’s Cabinet members nor his White House staff are willing to serve as a check on presidential bad behavior. And so last week, Trump did what not even Nixon had dared, becoming the first president ever to fire his BLS commissioner.</p><p>When he is seized by his dark passions, our current president doesn’t even have a Haldeman.</p>",

You may not be able to fix the broader trends in society, but you can—and should—fix this in yourself.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/03/polite-words-is-please-rude/673397/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How please stopped being polite</a>]</i></p><p class=\"dropcap\">P<span class=\"smallcaps\">oliteness can be</span> defined in four ways. The first two are: <i>etiquette</i>, which governs basic manners and speech, and <i>conduct</i>, which involves actions such as holding open a door for someone to pass. The other two are a pair: <i>positive</i> politeness, which refers to doing courteous things for others, and <i>negative</i> politeness, which involves refraining from discourtesy. Social scientists define these forms of politeness not just as a set of behaviors but as part of personality. Specifically, one of the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/compose-own-ode-joy/680939/?utm_source=feed\">Big Five Personality Traits</a>—agreeableness—is made up of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12020\">compassion and politeness</a>. One well-regarded study from the 1990s estimated that the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00522.x\">heritability</a> of agreeableness is about 41 percent genetic, allowing us to infer that you inherit some politeness from your parents partly through your genes, but more through how you were brought up. This also implies that you can become more polite with good influences and by cultivating positive habits.</p><p>Some aspects of courtesy are fairly universal, such as saying <i>please</i> and <i>thank you</i>, as well as listening while others speak (positive politeness) without interrupting (negative politeness). Other courteous values vary around the world: Shaking hands is good manners in London but not in Bangkok; tipping a taxi driver is a common courtesy in New York but not in Tokyo. Some demographic variation in politeness also occurs, and gender norms can play a part too. For example, experiments show that American women generally receive <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00956.x\">more politeness</a> than men do, and show <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1981.9711655\">less courteous behavior</a> to men than vice versa.</p><p>None of us wants to be treated rudely, online or in person. The finding in studies that when someone is discourteous toward you they lower your well-being is so commonsense as to make citation scarcely necessary. Even witnessing rudeness toward others can lower your happiness, as experiments have <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-71704-9_49\">shown</a>: When media content contains sarcasm by the author and the comment sections are uncivil, readers become unhappier—even if they agree with the snarky writer or commenters. Rudeness just brings you down.</p><p>More surprising, perhaps, is the effect that <i>your</i> being courteous toward others has on your own mood. Researchers in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2021.2004126\">showed</a> that being polite to others raises happiness and lowers anger. This might be counterintuitive at first, because we may at times feel a powerful urge to be snippy—so doesn’t that mean that snapping at someone should make us feel better? The reverse is the case: Being impolite is more like scratching at your poison-ivy rash. Giving in to the urge makes things worse. I doubt you’ve ever felt great when you’ve known, deep down, that you’ve been a jerk, whereas you’ve almost certainly felt better when you’ve been your better angel. Being prosocial, even when you don’t feel like it or the object of your courtesy doesn’t deserve it, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12299\">has been proven to raise your mood</a>.</p><p>The effect is so powerful that you benefit from being polite even when your courtesy is extended toward nonhumans. Psychologists <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2025.2469522\">writing</a> in <i>The</i> <i>Journal of Positive Psychology</i><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2025.2469522\"> </a>set research participants a task to perform alongside a helping robot named Tako: Those who had a stronger urge to thank Tako for its help afterward were more likely than others to behave in a prosocial way in a subsequent task. This finding suggests that even being civil to an AI bot or other nonhuman interface matters; yelling at Siri or being curt with ChatGPT will lead you to behave worse with other people, and lower your well-being.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/07/how-be-polite-post-pandemic-etiquette-manners/619346/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Three rules for politeness during a confusing social transition</a>]</i></p><p class=\"dropcap\">In short, be polite for your <i>own</i> sake. And be aware that if tech-mediated interactions are making you less polite, that can still hurt <i>your</i> happiness. Quitting the internet or returning to a world without AI is impractical, so the solution to this challenge of courtesy lies in how you consciously decide to behave. Here are three rules for your conduct that I can suggest.</p><p><b>1. Make courtesy a habit, even when other humans are not involved.</b><br>\nMy late father had impeccable manners, and I have no doubt that if he were still alive, he would start every request to AI with <i>please</i> and finish it with <i>thank you</i>. Years ago, I would have made fun of that—<i>Dad, the bot doesn’t care!</i>—but I’m sure he wouldn’t have paid any attention, because I now understand that his good manners were a demonstration of decent behavior <i>to</i> himself, <i>about</i> himself. And they would have protected him from some of the unhappiness we see all around. So today, I try to imitate him, online and in person, whomever or whatever I’m interacting with.</p><p><b>2. Renounce snark, whether you’re witnessing it or using it yourself.</b><br>\nAs noted, media sarcasm can lower your well-being as its consumer. Yet mockery of others seems an integral part of modern communication, especially among people who wish to seem sophisticated. I try not to participate in this, because even if, in the moment, it can feel satisfying or make me laugh, I know the cost to my soul. I no longer read comment sections in publications, and when an author throws out an impolite barb, I stop reading altogether.</p><p><b>3. Respond to rudeness not with rudeness, but with courtesy.</b><br>\nIf your happiness correspondent got into social-media spats or angry public battles, that would be a bad look and very off-brand. So I always refrain. But I try to go further than self-restraint: If I need to react to a rude in-person remark or mean online comment, I try to see it as an opportunity to improve my well-being by responding with courtesy and dignity. This gets easier with practice, and I have never once been sorry for passing on the opportunity to retaliate with a nasty zinger. I’m only sorry when I fail to make use of the opportunity to do the right thing and feel good about it.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/intellectual-difference-diversity-happiness/675095/?utm_source=feed\">Arthur C.

And if so, are we too far gone to turn it around? On many days, things do look bleak, as online nastiness seems to become the dominant style. But my personal defense mechanism also aims to act as a countercultural force: I see politeness as today’s punk rock because it so transgresses the spirit of our times. And like punk rock, when you empower yourself with politeness, you feel exhilarated. It is the ultimate exercise in freedom: the freedom to be the person I want to be in the face of a cultural tyranny.</p><p>Thank you for reading this column.</p>\n<p><em>Want to learn more about leading a life that feels full and meaningful?
