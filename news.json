Then, when a customer tried to get a refund for something that wasn’t delivered, “Gustafsson fraudulently referred the payment processor to the proof of mailing for the Certificate of Ownership or other material as proof that the product itself was shipped and that the customer had received it so the refund requests would be denied.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A judge has scheduled a sentencing hearing for December 5th, where Gustafsson faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the fraud-related counts and up to 10 for the money laundering-related counts. Gustafsson must also pay as much as $1.3 million in restitution.</p>",

Its recordings are tagged with the date, time, location, and your driving speed; they’re stored on a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ\">microSD card</a>, which you need to purchase separately. You can view video clips on the R2-4K’s 2.4-inch display, or transfer them to your smartphone over Wi-Fi using Rove’s app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The R2-4K comes with a suction mount and 3M sticky mount, both of which can be installed anywhere on your windshield. The suction mount is easier to move, so we recommend using it to find the dash cam’s permanent place before you decide whether to switch to the sticky mount. The dash cam needs to be connected to its power adapter with a USB-C cable (two are included), so make sure to mount it in an area where the cable won’t dangle and distract you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under normal circumstances, the R2-4K will take a continuous time lapse recording and overwrite older footage once the microSD card is filled. However, you can push an “Emergency Lock” button to preserve a specific clip. The dash cam’s built-in G-Sensor will detect an impact and automatically lock that section of video. If the dash cam stops recording, it’ll announce that so you can see what’s wrong. Hopefully you’ll never have to use Rove’s R2-4K for anything important, but it’s handy to have just in case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>",

Dell was showing off some of its new products, and one of the accessories was this little puck-looking item with several ports around its periphery. But the neatest thing was that it had its own USB-C connector on a short cable that revealed itself when you spun the base in a clockwise direction. Then, when you spun it counterclockwise, the cable pulled neatly back into the base. It looked both ingenious and useful, and as soon as it was available, I bought one for myself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br><strong>Why did you want one?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>My first laptops had lots of ports, but as the computers got thinner, the ports began to disappear. Eventually, most of the laptops I used only had one or two USB-C ports for anything I wanted to physically connect to my device. This little adapter lets me use a variety of different connectors, including some that belong to my older devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br><strong>What do you like about it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>As I mentioned before, it includes a number of different ports, some of which are no longer in use but I prefer to have on hand. The model I have, the DA300, comes with an ethernet port, a USB-C and USB-A port, an HDMI port, a VGA port, and a DisplayPort. There are other, newer models with a different selection of ports. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I also think the whole spin-the-disk-and-the-cable-disappears thing is a lot of fun.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257858_Fave_Dell_adapter_BKrasnoff_0002.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br><strong>Is there anything about it that you dislike, or that you think could be improved?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>A slot for a microSD card would have been handy. And a color other than black might have been nice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just FYI: Dell has replaced my model with the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-6-in-1-usb-c-multiport-adapter-da305/apd/470-afji/wifi-and-networking\">DA305</a>, which trades the VGA port for a second USB-A port and switches up the USB from 3.1 to 3.2. Amazon still seems to be carrying the DA300, but I’m not sure how long that’s going to last.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Who would you recommend it to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br>There are a lot of good desk-based adapters out there, but this one is great for popping into your backpack just in case you need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Dell USB-C Mobile Adapter (DA300)</h3>\n\n<img alt=\"Round Dell mobile adapter with a cable pulled out of it.\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-4.01.14 PM.png?w=300\" width=\"300\">\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dell-USB-C-Mobile-Adapter-DA300/dp/B079MDQDP4/ref=sr_1_3\"> $60 $55.97 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Dell-USB-C-Mobile-Adapter-DA300-Black-DELL-DA300/16203519312\"> $67.99 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li></ul></div>",
