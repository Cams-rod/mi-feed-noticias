Why are you laughing? (In fact, since saying that yesterday, he’s already chickened out with <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114948452793702817\">Mexico</a>, putting the “taco” in, well, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/taco-donald-trump-wall-street-tariffs/682994/?utm_source=feed\">TACO</a>.)</p><p>But the president has already written off hopes of reaching agreements with some allies. Yesterday, Trump announced that he was raising tariffs on many Brazilian goods to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/world/americas/trump-sanctions-brazil-judge-bolsonaro.html\">50 percent across the board</a>, as retribution for Brazil’s prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. This morning, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114945962278773358\">wrote on Truth Social</a> that Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state “will make it very hard” to strike a deal with Canada.</p><p>The president’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/trump-almost-always-folds/560948/?utm_source=feed\">perpetual caving</a> can make him seem craven and opportunistic, but you can detect a different impulse in his handling of trade policy too: a warped kind of idealism. When Trump began his political career, he said he would put “<a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/trump-campaign-press-release-donald-j-trump-delivers-major-foreign-policy-address\">America First</a>,” rather than using American power to enforce values overseas. Wars to fight repressive autocrats were foolish ways to burn cash and squander American lives. The promotion of human rights and democracy were soft-headed, bleeding-heart causes. Trump, a man of business, was going to look out for the bottom line without getting tangled up in high-minded crusades. Now that’s exactly what he’s doing: using trade as a way to make grand statements about values—his own, if not America’s.</p><p>This is troubling on legal, moral, and diplomatic levels. The Constitution specifically delegates the power to levy tariffs to Congress, but legislators have delegated some of that capacity to the president. Trump has invoked the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-congress-delegates-its-tariff-powers-to-the-president\">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a>, which allows him to impose tariffs in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” on the basis that Congress cannot act quickly enough. This use of the law is, as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-tariffs-court-rulings/682964/?utm_source=feed\">Conor Friedersdorf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-tariffs-separation-powers/682982/?utm_source=feed\">Ilya Somin</a> wrote in <i>The Atlantic </i>in May, absurd. The White House’s months of vacillation on its tariff threats since make the idea of any emergency even less credible.</p><p>Understanding why Trump would be sensitive about Bolsonaro’s prosecution, which stems from Bolsonaro’s attempt to cling to power after losing the 2022 election, is not difficult—the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-steve-bannon-politics-brazil-government-22a083f0d08bb9d1d93b67871a103b0c\">parallels</a> between the two have been often noted—but that doesn’t make it a threat to the United States, much less an “unusual and extraordinary” one. Likewise, Canadian recognition of a Palestinian state is unwelcome news for Trump’s close alliance with Israel, but it poses no obvious security or economic danger to the U.S. A Congress or Supreme Court interested in limiting presidential power could seize on these statements to arrest Trump’s trade war, but these are not the legislators or justices we have.</p><p>Setting aside the legal problems, Trump’s statements about Brazil and Canada represent an abandonment of the realpolitik approach he once promised. Even if Carney were to back down on Palestinian statehood, or Brazil to call off Bolsonaro’s prosecution, the United States wouldn’t see any economic gain. Trump is purely using American economic might to achieve noneconomic goals.</p><p>Previous presidents have frequently used U.S. economic hegemony to further national goals—or, less charitably, interfered in the domestic affairs of other sovereign nations. But no one needs to accept any nihilistic false equivalences. Trump wrote in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114825119138468153\">July 9 letter</a> to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that the case against Bolsonaro was “an international disgrace” and (naturally) a “Witch Hunt.” Although the U.S. has taken steps to isolate repressive governments, Trump’s attempts to bail out Bolsonaro are nothing of the sort. The U.S. can’t with a straight face argue that charging Bolsonaro is improper, and it can’t accuse Brazil of convicting him in a kangaroo court, because no trial has yet been held.</p><p>The U.S. government has also long used its power to bully other countries into taking its side in international disputes, but the swipe at Canada is perplexing. The Trump administration remains the most stalwart ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (notwithstanding some recent <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-netanyahu-gaza-famine/683720/?utm_source=feed\">tensions</a>), and the U.S. government has long withheld recognition of any Palestinian state as leverage in negotiations. Even so, slapping tariffs on Canada for a symbolic decision such as this seems unlikely to dissuade Carney or do anything beyond further stoking <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/canada-day-nationalism-trump/683373/?utm_source=feed\">nascent Canadian nationalism</a>.</p><p>This is not the only way in which Trump’s blunt wielding of tariffs is likely to backfire on the United States. Consumers in the U.S. will pay higher prices, and overseas, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-tariff-chaos-unfixable/682419/?utm_source=feed\">Jerusalem Demsas</a> warned in April, “the credibility of the nation’s promises, its treaties, its agreements, and even its basic rationality has evaporated in just weeks.” But it’s not just trust with foreign countries that the president has betrayed. It’s the pact he made with voters. Trump promised voters an “America First” approach. Instead, they’re getting a “Bolsonaro and Netanyahu First” government.</p><p><b>Related:</b></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/taco-donald-trump-wall-street-tariffs/682994/?utm_source=feed\">The TACO presidency </a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/07/trump-tariffs-trade-war-ongoing/683476/?utm_source=feed\">Start budgeting for Trump’s tariffs now.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Here are three new stories from <em>The Atlantic</em>:</strong></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-trump/683717/?utm_source=feed\">Virginia Giuffre’s family was shocked that Trump described her as “stolen.”</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/07/science-empire-america-decline/683711/?utm_source=feed\">Every scientific empire comes to an end.</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/hamas-wants-famine/683724/?utm_source=feed\">Hamas wants Gaza to starve.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h5><b>Today’s News</b></h5><ol>\n\t<li>President Donald Trump’s tariffs are set to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/31/trump-tariffs-face-legal-challenge/\">take effect tomorrow</a> as his administration scrambles to finalize trade deals with key partners.

But recently, researchers have begun to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05706\">revise that dour view</a>. With the right blend of genetic material, hybrids can sometimes be fertile and spawn species of their own; they can acquire new abilities that help them succeed in ways their parents never could. Which, as Knapp and her colleagues have found in a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00736-6\">new study</a>, appears to be the case for the world’s third-most important staple crop: The 8-to-9-million-year-old lineage that begat the modern potato may have arisen from a chance encounter between a flowering plant from a group called Etuberosum and … an ancient tomato.</p>\n\n<p>Tomatoes, in other words, can now justifiably be described as the mother of potatoes.</p>\n</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/07/potato-tomato-evolution-hybrid/683721/?utm_source=feed\">Read the full article.</a></p><p><b>More From <em>The Atlantic</em></b></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-netanyahu-gaza-famine/683720/?utm_source=feed\">Why Trump broke with Bibi over the Gaza famine</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/ice-budget-immigration-enforcement/683678/?utm_source=feed\">ICE’s mind-bogglingly massive blank check</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/south-park-trump-episode-paramount-satire/683722/?utm_source=feed\">Why <i>South Park </i>did an about-face on mocking Trump</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/07/can-san-francisco-be-saved/683594/?utm_source=feed\"><i>No Easy Fix</i>: Can San Francisco be saved?</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/07/vinay-prasad-maha-trump/683715/?utm_source=feed\">The man who was too MAHA for the Trump administration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Culture Break</b></p>\n<img alt=\"2025 world aquatics championship\" height=\"2807\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/newsletters/2025/07/cultute/original.jpg\" width=\"4210\">\n\nNg Han Guan / AP\n<p><b>Take a look.</b> These photos capture <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photography/archive/2025/07/scenes-2025-world-aquatics-championships/683719/?utm_source=feed\">moments from the 2025 World Aquatics Championships</a> in Singapore, where more than 2,500 athletes from over 200 nations competed in events spanning six aquatic sports.</p><p><b>Read.</b> In 2022, Sophia Stewart recommended <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/09/music-memoirs-criticism-books/671517/?utm_source=feed\">six books</a> that all music lovers should read.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/free-daily-crossword-puzzle/?utm_source=feed\">Play our daily crossword.</a></p>\n<p><i>Rafaela Jinich </i><i>contributed to this newsletter.</i></p><p><em>When you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

Trying to keep up with what Holmes called the “excitements of the time,” civilians lived their days newspaper to newspaper, hanging on the latest reports. Reading anything else felt beside the point.</p><p>The newspaper was an inescapable force, Holmes wrote; it ruled by “divine right of its telegraphic dispatches.” Holmes didn’t think he was describing some permanent modern condition—information dependency as a way of life. The newspaper’s reign would end with the war, he thought. And when it did, he and others could return to more high-minded literary pursuits—such as the book by an “illustrious author” that he’d put down when hostilities broke out.</p><p>Nearly 40 years after Holmes wrote those words, newspapers were still on the march. Writing in 1900, Arthur Reed Kimball warned in <i>The Atlantic</i> of an “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1900/07/the-invasion-of-journalism/636300/?utm_source=feed\">Invasion of Journalism</a>,” as newspapers’ volume and influence grew only more intense. Their readers’ intellect, Kimball argued, had been diminished. Coarse language was corrupting speech and writing, and miscellaneous news was making miscellaneous minds. The newspaper-ification of the American mind was complete.</p><p>The rise of the cheap, daily newspaper in the 19th century created the first true attention economy—an endless churn of spectacle and sensation that remade how Americans engaged with the world. Although bound by the physical limits of print, early newspaper readers’ habits were our habits: People craved novelty, skimmed for the latest, let their attention dart from story to story. And with the onset of this new way of being came its first critics.</p><p>In our current moment, when readers need to be persuaded to read an article before they post about it online, 19th-century harrumphs over the risks of newspaper reading seem quaint. Each new technology since the newspaper—film, radio, television, computers, the internet, search engines, social media, artificial intelligence—has sparked the same anxieties about how our minds and souls will be changed. Mostly, we’ve endured. But these anxieties have always hinted at the possibility that one day, we’ll reach the endgame—the point at which words and the work of the mind will have become redundant.</p><p>Worries over journalism’s invasive qualities are as old as the modern daily newspaper. In New York, where the American variant first took shape in the 1830s, enterprising editors found a formula for success; they covered fires, murders, swindles, scandals, steamboat explosions, and other acts in the city’s daily circus. As James Gordon Bennett Sr., the editor of the <i>New York Herald</i> and the great pioneer of the cheap daily, said, the mission was “to startle or amuse.” Small in size and packed with tiny type, the papers themselves didn’t look particularly amusing, but the newsboys selling them in the street were startling enough. Even if you didn’t buy a paper, a boy in rags was going to yell its contents at you.</p><p>These cheap newspapers had relatively modest urban circulations, but they suggested a new mode of living, an acceleration of time rooted in an expectation of constant novelty. Henry David Thoreau and other contrarians saw the implications and counseled the careful conservation of attention. “We should treat our minds,” Thoreau wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1863/10/life-without-principle/542217/?utm_source=feed\">essay posthumously published</a> in <i>The Atlantic</i>, “that is, ourselves, as innocent and ingenuous children, whose guardians we are, and be careful what objects and what subjects we thrust on their attention.” This included newspapers. “Read not the Times,” he urged. “Read the Eternities.”</p><p>But the problem was only getting worse. The Eternities were steadily losing ground to the Times—and to the Posts, the Standards, the Gazettes, the Worlds, and the Examiners. In the last third of the 19th century, the volume of printed publications grew exponentially. Even as more “serious” newspapers such as the <i>New-York Tribune</i> entered the marketplace, the cheap daily continued to sell thousands of copies each day. Newspapers, aided by faster methods of typesetting and by cheaper printing, became twice-daily behemoths, with Sunday editions that could be biblical in length. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Americanization_of_the_World/rfhMRutCAX8C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22the+busiest+people+in+the+world+who+have+less+time%22&amp;pg=PA291&amp;printsec=frontcover\">A British observer</a> marveled at the turn of the century that Americans, “the busiest people in the world,” had so much time to read each day.</p><p>American commentators of high and furrowed brow worried less that newspapers were being left unread and more that they were actually being devoured. The evidence was everywhere—in snappier sermons on Sundays, in direct and terse orations at colleges, in colloquial expressions in everyday usage, in the declining influence of certain journals and magazines (including <i>The Atlantic</i>).</p><p>If I may apply what Kimball deplored as “newspaper directness,” people seemed to be getting dumber. Those who were reared on slop and swill wanted ever more slop and swill—and the newspapers were all too ready to administer twice-daily feedings. Writing in <i>The Atlantic</i> in 1891 on the subject of “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/11/journalism-and-literature/634428/?utm_source=feed\">Journalism and Literature</a>,” William James Stillman saw a broad and “devastating influence of the daily paper” on Americans’ “mental development.” No less grave were the political implications of a populace marinating in half-truths, seeking the general confirmation of what it already believed. In such a market, journalists and their papers had an incentive to perpetuate falsehoods.</p><p>Was all of this hand-wringing a little too much? Has not one generation predicted the doom of the next with each successive innovation? Socrates warned that writing would weaken thought and give only the appearance of wisdom. Eighteenth-century novels occasioned panic as critics worried that their readers would waste their days on vulgar fictions. And as for newspapers, didn’t Ernest Hemingway famously take “newspaper directness” and make it the basis for perhaps the most influential literary style of the 20th century? Each innovation, even those that risk dimming our broader mental capacity, can stimulate innovations of its own.</p><p>But at the risk of sounding like those 19th-century critics, this time really does seem different. When machines can so agreeably perform all of our intellectual labors and even fulfill our emotional needs, we should wonder what will become of our minds. No one has to spend much time imagining what we might like to read or pretend to read; algorithms already know. Chatbots, meanwhile, can as readily make our emails sound like Hemingway as they can instruct us on how to perform <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/chatgpt-ai-self-mutilation-satanism/683649/?utm_source=feed\">devil worship and self-mutilation</a>. Thoreau may have never divined the possibility of artificial intelligence, but he did fear minds smoothed out by triviality and ease. He imagined the intellect as a road being paved over—“<a href=\"https://www.wordsmith.org/words/macadamize.html\">macadamized</a>,” in 19th-century parlance—“its foundation broken into fragments for the wheels of travel to roll over.”</p><p>“If I am to be a thoroughfare,” Thoreau wrote, “I prefer that it be of the mountain-brooks, the Parnassian streams, and not the town-sewers.”</p><p>Wouldn’t we all. But who has the time for that?</p>",

    "content": "<p>Vinay Prasad, until Tuesday one of the country’s top medical regulators, just got a bitter taste of what it means to have real power. In recent months, the academic hematologist-oncologist, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/15/vinay-prasad-profile/\">medical contrarian</a>, and polemic podcaster had become a central figure at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In May, he was chosen to lead its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research—a position that gave him authority over vaccines and gene therapies. In June, Marty Makary, who is currently the FDA commissioner, bestowed upon him an even more important role: chief medical and scientific officer of the entire agency. This week, Prasad abruptly departed.</p><p>We don’t know the exact reason behind Prasad’s departure. According to a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/health/vinay-prasad-fda-resigns-loomer.html?searchResultPosition=1\">resigned</a> to “spend more time with his family.” (Neither Prasad nor HHS responded to my request for comment.) <em>Politico</em> reports that President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/30/white-house-drove-prasad-firing-despite-rfk-jr-makary-concerns-00485972\">ordered his removal</a> this week over the objections of Makary and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Whatever the particulars, Prasad’s sudden need for a better work-life balance suggests the administration is following a time-honored approach to medical regulation: Business comes first.</p><p>Prasad’s troubles began in the first weeks of his tenure at the FDA, when he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines.html\">overruled</a> the agency’s own scientific reviewers by limiting the use of COVID vaccines. In doing so, he managed to anger the country’s pro- and anti-vaccine factions at the same time. While many public-health experts <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/03/nx-s1-5421292/covid-vaccine-cdc-pregnant-kids-recommendations\">criticized</a> the decision to limit access to the shots, Kennedy’s allies in the “Make America healthy again” movement felt <a href=\"https://endpoints.news/fdas-continued-approval-of-mrna-shots-is-infuriating-some-in-maha/\">betrayed</a> by the fact that the government had allowed mRNA shots to remain available at all.</p><p>Prasad also faced a blitz from the pharmaceutical industry and patient-advocacy groups after the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-requests-sarepta-therapeutics-suspend-distribution-elevidys-and-places-clinical-trials-hold\">tried to suspend distribution</a> of a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy called Elevidys, over safety concerns. For those affected by this rare, incurable condition, the move was seen as an outrageous denial of their right to weigh the drug’s risks and benefits for themselves, and an extinguishing of what had been at least a glimmer of hope. Two days later, the right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer publicly <a href=\"https://loomered.com/2025/07/20/meet-vinay-prasad-the-progressive-leftist-saboteur-undermining-president-trumps-fda/\">accused</a> Prasad of “sabotaging Trump’s deregulatory agenda,” and an opinion writer for <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/vinay-prasad-is-a-bernie-sanders-acolyte-in-maha-drag-healthcare-bfc3be57\">declared</a> him a “one-man death panel.”</p><p>I know Prasad a bit: I’ve twice been a guest on his podcast, and I’ve followed his prolific academic work and public commentary about evidence-based medicine since about 2016, when he was a young professor at Oregon Health &amp; Science University working to <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/45183\">identify</a> low-value medical practices. We’ve had our disagreements over the years. But with respect to Elevidys and drugs like it, our views are in alignment. We share the worry, for example, that the FDA keeps lowering its approval standards for drugs that keep getting more expensive. “The American economy can handle a great deal of wasteful health-care spending,” Prasad <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/americas-drug-approval-system-unsustainable/619422/?utm_source=feed\">told me</a> in an interview in 2021. “But it can’t tolerate an infinite number.”</p><p>His skepticism of Elevidys, in particular, is both <a href=\"https://www.drugdevletter.com/p/why-should-a-top-fda-official-unilaterally\">long-standing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14712598.2024.2394477\">well-founded</a>. The therapy has not been conclusively shown to slow the progression of the muscle-wasting disease it targets, but it does often <a href=\"https://www.elevidys.com/about-elevidys/side-effects\">induce vomiting and damage patients’ livers</a>. Worryingly, it also appears to be <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/fda-investigating-deaths-due-acute-liver-failure-non-ambulatory-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-patients\">related</a> to a pair of deaths. Prasad’s predecessor in his role at CBER, Peter Marks, approved the drug, which costs $3.2 million per course of treatment, in spite of his own staff’s <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/sarepta-duchenne-elevidys-fda-approval-peter-marks-overruled-staff/\">uncertainty</a> about its benefit. (Marks was forced out by Kennedy this spring, after the two clashed over access to <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/ex-official-says-he-was-forced-out-of-fda-after-trying-to-protect-vaccine-safety-data-from-rfk-jr/\">vaccine-safety data</a>.)</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/rfk-jr-hhs-sanewashing/680663/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The sanewashing of RFK Jr.</a>]</i></p><p>That Prasad should take a tough line on drug regulation was perfectly in keeping with his history. He rose to prominence on that basis: To his many fans, he was a dogged and courageous industry watchdog; to his many critics, a self-righteous <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2017/09/dr_vinay_prasad_ohsus_iconocla.html\">pharma scold</a>. That mainstream Republicans should balk at this approach, and strive to undo it, was equally predictable. Politicians, particularly those on the right, have for years supported patients’ ability to obtain still-unproven therapies. During Trump’s first term, the president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/politics/right-to-try-donald-trump/index.html\">signed into law</a> the “Right to Try Act,” which expanded access to experimental drugs. That law was <a href=\"https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/right-to-try\">championed</a> by Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who, according to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/vinay-prasad-analysis-departure-fda-cber-director-top-vaccine-official/\">reporting</a> from <em>STAT</em>, may have been instrumental in Prasad’s ouster.</p><p>One might have guessed that things were different now in Washington—that Kennedy’s eccentric philosophy had ushered in a novel form of conservative leadership, in which business interests didn’t always lead the way. Thus far, however, the MAHA movement has done little to adjust the status quo. Instead, it has mostly wallowed in its own contradictions. We’ve been told that cooking with seed oils is toxic but that treating measles with cod-liver oil is great; and that both <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/ivermectin-miracle-drug-right-wing-aspirin/683197/?utm_source=feed\">deworming pills</a> and microbe-laden raw milk are <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737\">good for you</a>. MAHA leaders have declared the FDA a “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-calls-fda-sock-puppet-industry-private-speech-agency-staff-rcna200910\">sock puppet of industry</a>” from which Prasad himself would provide a “<a href=\"https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1919822992873288168\">welcome reprieve</a>,” while also championing the public’s <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-promoted-freedom-choice-limiting-vaccines-food/story?id=122526364\">right to choose</a> its food and drugs (even as they interfere with the distribution of some vaccines).</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/06/ivermectin-miracle-drug-right-wing-aspirin/683197/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How ivermectin became right-wing aspirin</a>]</i></p><p>So which is it? Should people have easy access to almost any health-care intervention, or should the government protect vulnerable patients from drugs for which there isn’t rigorous evidence of benefit? For years, Prasad has been clear on where he stands in that regard. “It is not a case of patients who crave risk facing off with regulators who abhor it,” he <a href=\"https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(18)30845-3/pdf\">wrote</a> in a medical journal in 2019. Rather, the current system, in which “reliable data are inconsistently generated,” has failed patients who wish to make informed decisions about their care.</p><p>Whenever this tension has been tested in the Trump administration, MAHA leaders have almost always seemed inclined to move the other way. A recent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/cooperation-is-the-key-to-maha-healthcare-nutrition-wellness-policy-7a76a0af\">op-ed</a> by the FDA’s Makary and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/dr-oz-senate-hearing/682102/?utm_source=feed\">Mehmet Oz</a>, the head of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, summed up the current regulatory approach as follows: Agency bureaucrats should cooperate with industry leaders instead of antagonizing them, and the government should favor “market solutions” over “prescriptive regulation.” Indeed, even as the news of Prasad’s firing was coming out, Makary was promoting his “national listening tour” of private interests. “Looking forward to hearing from more pharma and biotech CEOs!” he <a href=\"https://x.com/drmakaryfda/status/1950542068800975031?s=46&amp;t=uR0fNjtfNllt8IsbapT0iw\">wrote</a> on X.</p><p>Prasad himself appeared to recognize which way the wind was blowing. From the moment he took office, he was tempering his point of view. Before he became a political appointee, Prasad was dogmatic in his dismissal of evidence that did not emerge from large, randomized clinical trials. (“As readers know, my philosophy is <a href=\"https://www.drvinayprasad.com/p/mayo-clinic-suspends-a-doctor-who\">RCT or STFU</a>,” he wrote in his newsletter in 2023.) But Prasad seemed to back away from this idea even in his opening remarks to his new colleagues and staffers. “Randomized controlled trials are not always necessary, and when they are done, they are not always informative,” he reportedly <a href=\"https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-randomized-controlled-trials\">said</a> on May 7, his second day on the job.</p><p>Such appeasement efforts proved insufficient to protect him from rival forces in the Republican Party, if not also in the MAHA movement itself. For the moment, Prasad has been <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/george-tidmarsh-fda-cber-biologics-vaccines-center-acting-director/\">replaced</a> at CBER by the wealthy biomedical entrepreneur George Tidmarsh. Surely that will come as a relief to a constituency that seems to hold immense sway with this administration: America’s drug companies and medical-device makers.</p>",

The futile policies pursued by the Israeli government—prodded by the far-right cabinet ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir—have reduced the supply of humanitarian aid, food, and supplies in Gaza. Israel has unnecessarily reengineered the distribution of aid, failing to achieve its goal of separating the civilian population from Hamas while further constricting its supply. And for these decisions, it has attracted the justified condemnation of the international community.</p><p>Despite the surge of hundreds of trucks into Gaza over the past four days, very few supplies have made it into warehouses to be distributed to the population. Aid shipments are being seized by a combination of desperate civilians, lawless gangs, clan-affiliated thugs, and merchants of death. Chaos and apocalyptic scenery are the norm, not the exception. There is no denying the reality of the widespread malnutrition and hunger in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>In recent days, I’ve spoken with dozens of Gazans who are furious about what is unfolding around them. They are angry, one told me, at the “hordes of selfish people who are attacking aid convoys to steal and collect aid in a horrific manner without caring for Gazans who chose not to participate in these humiliating and demeaning displays of inhumanity, no matter the level of hunger.” But their anger is directed primarily at Hamas, which they hold responsible for putting the people of Gaza in this position, and for its continued refusal to end the war that it started. “Hitler fought in his bunker until he killed himself in World War II in the Battle of Berlin,” another person said, complaining that Hamas is hunkered down in its tunnels, willing to see Gaza destroyed to the very last child.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/corrupt-bargain-behind-gazas-catastrophe/683690/?utm_source=feed\">Yair Rosenberg: The corrupt bargain behind Gaza’s catastrophe</a>]</i></p><p>Hamas actually wants a famine in Gaza. Producing mass death from hunger is the group’s final play, its last hope for ending the war in a way that advances its goals. Hamas has benefited from Israel’s decision to use food as a lever against the terror group, because the catastrophic conditions for civilians have generated an international outcry, which is worsening Israel’s global standing and forcing it to reverse course.</p><p>Online supporters of the terror group have consistently attacked any efforts to alleviate the crisis. In posts and videos, they have dismissed efforts to send in food by convoys of trucks from Egypt and Jordan, pointing to the chaotic scenes as desperate Gazans scramble for aid. They have likewise attacked the airdrops that are now under way and called for them to be stopped immediately.  </p><p>Hamas’s evident desire to extend and deepen the crisis of hunger helps explain the recent breakdown of cease-fire negotiations, even as Gazans are needlessly dying. The group’s intransigence led both Israel and Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, to walk away from the talks. If the hunger crisis and humanitarian issues are addressed, Hamas can no longer use the suffering of Gazans to generate an international outcry or use the resultant leverage to end the war on its own terms.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-netanyahu-gaza-famine/683720/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Why Trump broke with Bibi over the Gaza famine</a>]</i></p><p>But the two-state-solution conference convened by France and Saudi Arabia at the United Nations shows the way forward. In a remarkable statement, endorsed by the European Union and the Arab League, the participants condemned the October 7 attacks and the taking of hostages, and declared that “Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority.” The conference envisions the end of hostilities, the establishment of an international mission in Gaza, and the ultimate return of the Palestinian Authority to govern the Strip.</p><p>Many Arab states have been reluctant to call out Hamas publicly, even though they do so privately on a regular basis, for fear of upsetting their own populations. But now they have recognized the importance of openly and transparently calling for Hamas to give up control of Gaza and disarm. Both Israel and the international community should capitalize on this shift, to isolate the terrorist organization and give hope for a better trajectory for Gaza’s future.</p><p>If Hamas believes that the suffering of Gazans bolsters its cause, Israeli decision makers should take that to heart. They should abandon their misguided and inhumane policies and cease their efforts to pressure the population as a means of pressuring the terror group. The best way to undermine Hamas’s position is to instead flood Gaza with food, and to alleviate the suffering of its people.</p>",

The authors of the study found evidence that many high-achieving women felt insecurity about their abilities—“an internal experience of intellectual phoniness.” Later research <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-019-05364-1\">found</a> that this phenomenon applied not just to women or to any particular demographic group; “impostor phenomenon,” as they labeled it (<i>syndrome</i> was a later refinement), was something anyone could experience. (One exception is age—older people experience it less than younger adults.)</p><p>A number of tests have been validated for impostor syndrome. One is the<a href=\"https://paulineroseclance.com/pdf/IPTestandscoring.pdf\"> Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale</a>, which asks respondents whether they agree with such statements as “I’m afraid people important to me may find out that I’m not as capable as they think I am.” (You can get an idea of how you score on the scale by using a slimmed-down <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/tests/personality/imposter-syndrome-test\">online</a> survey.) By testing, researchers find that certain personalities tend to experience the syndrome more than others. People high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327752JPA7802_07\">are more afflicted</a> than others. Perhaps not surprisingly, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002945923000773\">introverts</a> are prone to feeling fake more than extroverts (who tend toward <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910004654?casa_token=JVV1HLMeLwgAAAAA:uIn5e37gUqi9-7302nssVEoS9Zz5Jgj5zigh2TzC1iB4vE3VCp4Pq0JSJL6rd75gc9VxX0G2Gyo#b0115\">narcissism</a>). <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/611819624.pdf\">Perfectionists</a> typically feel like phonies, because they’re so focused on their own perceived errors.</p><p>Impostor syndrome tends to manifest among people who work in highly technical fields that require the trust of others. Multiple studies have found a high incidence among young physicians: For a 2021 survey, more than three-quarters of surgical residents <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/journalacs/fulltext/2021/11000/imposter_syndrome_in_surgical_trainees__clance.6.aspx\">reported</a> a significant or severe feeling of being an impostor. I suspect this occurs because doctors think that they must demonstrate a great deal of confidence they don’t authentically feel—which is indeed a form of phoniness, albeit a functionally necessary one. You hardly want your surgeon saying, “Hmm, let’s see how this goes, then,” as you’re being wheeled into the operating room. And if you’re a parent, remember the way your kid looked at you when they were little—with complete trust. <i>If they only knew</i>, I used to think.</p><p>Some scholars have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00048402.2021.1874445\">argued</a> that impostor syndrome can theoretically lead to higher performance in tasks, insofar as it provides an emotional motivation to succeed. If you’re telling yourself that you’re merely a poser, you will be impelled to improve, the theory goes. But just as such denigration would be destructive when applied to a child, such an abusive method, when self-inflicted, can have huge psychic costs, possibly provoking <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Loretta-Mcgregor/publication/233635912_I_feel_like_a_fraud_and_it_depresses_me_The_relation_between_the_imposter_phenomenon_and_depression/links/57606b4508ae227f4a3f269b/I-feel-like-a-fraud-and-it-depresses-me-The-relation-between-the-imposter-phenomenon-and-depression.pdf\">depression</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919300790\">anxiety</a>. Such negative feedback can also <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886998000658\">lead</a> to cognitive distortion, causing its subjects to discount legitimate compliments and overgeneralize failure. This makes useful learning harder and is <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-019-05364-1\">associated</a> with impaired job satisfaction and burnout.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/10/writing-advice-ambition-imposter-syndrome/676493/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When you fear that your writing doesn’t measure up to your ambitions</a>]</i></p><p class=\"dropcap\">I<span class=\"smallcaps\">f you experience </span>impostor syndrome, your well-being is almost certainly compromised. Fortunately, several straightforward ways to treat the condition are available.</p><p><b>1. Don’t talk to yourself like someone you hate.</b><br>\nJust as you wouldn’t, or shouldn’t, tell your spouse or your child that they’re an incompetent idiot, you should avoid speaking that way to yourself. Kinder self-talk might sound like the sort of indulgent self-focus that characterizes narcissism, which would indeed hazard phoniness, but in this necessary therapeutic context, it is simply recognizing reality: You are <i>not</i> an incompetent idiot; you are simply a person hoping to learn and improve.</p><p><b>2. Track your progress.</b><br>\nWhether you’re a surgeon or a parent (or both), when engaged in a challenging task, try framing your activity as an opportunity for growth and learning. Keep an account of your personal progress to create an objective record of your momentum toward your goals, as opposed to obsessing over what you haven’t yet achieved. So for example, if you’ve recently started a new job, think each day about the new skills and knowledge you’ve acquired, rather than worrying about what you still don’t know or can’t do. Keep a log of these accomplishments and review it regularly.</p><p><b>3. Get some company.</b><br>\nBuilding or joining a community of people similarly situated professionally can be very helpful. This provides a peer group with whom you can speak frankly about any insecurities and discover that such doubts are quite common. This turned out to be a benefit of the Lean In movement started by Sheryl Sandberg, the former Meta executive, because the circles of professional women it created were invited to share the experiences that held them back—and <a href=\"https://leanin.org/news-inspiration/overcoming-imposter-syndrome-to-reveal-your-presence\">impostor syndrome</a> was a very typical example. The business group YPO’s<a href=\"https://www.ypo.org/profile/ypo-forum/\"> Forum</a> program for young chief executives is based on a similar idea, which members find enormously helpful as a venue for unburdening themselves of feelings of isolation and insecurity.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/art-self-control-provocation/683205/?utm_source=feed\">Arthur C.

Despite the temporary misery he confided to his diary, Steinbeck clearly was no fraud: <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> went on to win the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was a major factor in his later being awarded the Nobel Prize. But we should consider a phenomenon closely related to the syndrome: people who disingenuously <i>claim</i> to be impostors, even though they don’t think they are, out of false modesty. I’m talking about the humblebraggarts who say such things as “I’m the <i>last</i> person to deserve the personal invitation I just got from the president to visit the White House!”</p><p>Nothing is phonier, of course, than this veneer of humility. The humblebrag’s ruse is transparent, and makes its perpetrator instantly irritating and unlikable—a bit like, well, a <i>phony</i>.</p>\n<p><em>Want to learn more about leading a life that feels full and meaningful?
