This week alone, he’s appeared on a number of podcasts in what seem to be early forays into an exploratory campaign for president. Emanuel went on the former Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s podcast and answered <a href=\"https://youtu.be/53fVtQF1UOQ?feature=shared&amp;t=1313\">“no”</a> when asked if a man can “become a woman.” On another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4GHSu4Jo4s\">podcast</a>, with <i>The Free Press</i>’s Bari Weiss, Emanuel said that Democrats lost in 2024 because Kamala Harris didn’t set herself apart from Joe Biden, and noted that his party “got sidetracked” by issues that were not front of mind for voters.</p><p>Emanuel was the most visible in the media this week, but he’s not the only would-be candidate we’re hearing from. This morning, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg went on the podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMBLcb71nDU\"><i>The Breakfast Club</i></a>; he also made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ7Vzl-lKXo&amp;t=3901s\">surprise cameo</a> on a Barstool Sports podcast last week to present a jokey “Lib of the Year” award to the internet personality Jersey Jerry, who was wearing a MAGA hat. In an elegant <i>Vogue</i> <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/andy-beshear-kentucky-governor-september-2025\">spread</a>, an old-school and somewhat stiff way to communicate one’s political ambitions, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear bragged about having once been on MrBeast’s show. “We’ve got to do the YouTube shows,” he said, telling the reporter that, unlike Harris, he would have gone on <i>The Joe Rogan Experience</i>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx7GvYSq64\">Buttigieg</a> and Representative <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL46joFCeQA\">Ro Khanna</a> of California have both appeared on the comedy podcast <i>Flagrant</i>, co-hosted by Andew Schulz. California Governor Gavin Newsom invited the conservative activist Charlie Kirk to be a guest on the <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/this-is-gavin-newsom/introducing-this-is-gavin-newsom\">first episode</a> of his podcast.</p><p>These appearances indicate that Democrats “are finally waking up to the fact that you can’t run a presidential campaign” simply “by going on CNN and MSNBC,” Lis Smith, a Democratic strategist who worked on Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, told me. And these public appearances aren’t just a way for presidential hopefuls to introduce themselves to voters; they’re also opportunities for donors and party elites to start eyeballing their favorites and winnowing the primary field.</p><p>Most party strategists I’ve spoken with this year believe that Democrats need to appear on more nontraditional and ideologically diverse outlets to reach new voters and make more people—even those who don’t agree with the Democrats on everything—feel welcome inside the party tent. Donald Trump’s successful turns on Rogan’s podcast and on shows hosted by the comedians Theo Von and Schulz contributed to his victory last November.</p><p>Democratic hopefuls everywhere are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/09/frustrated-dems-unleash-the-f-bombs-00218336\">swearing more</a> and attempting to adopt a little more swagger. In his interview with Weiss, Emanuel, who once <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/us/illinois-governor-chicago-mayor-feud-leads-to-dead-fish-idUSL1N12U2PL/\">sent a dead fish</a> to a political enemy, <a href=\"https://x.com/bariweiss/status/1947769159175311772\">leaned back</a> in his chair, looking unbothered; Buttigieg <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx7GvYSq64\">chopped it up</a> with the bros on <i>Flagrant</i> for more than two hours. Notably, some female potential candidates aren’t yet in the mix—where’s Gretchen Whitmer these days? Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, told me that she didn’t know, but that it’s clear the party’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/democrats-man-problem/682029/?utm_source=feed\">decline in support from men</a> “has really lit a fire under Democratic dudes.”</p><p>Along with a broader shift in media strategy, we’re also seeing a shift in rhetoric from at least some Democrats. “These folks are right that the Democratic Party was seen as too extreme, and that contributed to our loss,” Erickson told me. She’s pleased, she said, that the current zeitgeist seems to be a move “toward the middle.” The Democratic course correction has begun.</p><p>Part of that involves punching left. After Emanuel told Kelly that a man cannot become a woman, Kelly sighed, lamenting, “Why don’t more people in your party just say that?” “Because,” Emanuel joked, “I’m now going to go into a witness-protection plan.”<b> </b>Newsom told Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports is “deeply unfair,” and had broader critiques of the Democratic Party’s communication skills.</p><p>Democrats on the campaign trail have had a difficult time addressing topics around gender. One <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html\">analysis</a> conducted by a Democratic super PAC found that a Republican ad about Harris’s views on transgender identity was effective for <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-dishonest-gender-conversation-2024-election/680604/?utm_source=feed\">Trump</a> during the 2024 campaign. (Many Democrats criticized Harris’s campaign for refusing to respond to the ad, whose tagline read: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”) Emanuel’s answer on Kelly’s show, whether or not it’s a winning message with the Democratic base, speaks to a tone change on the topic. Every 2028 hopeful can expect to be asked directly about their views on the subject—and “should be ready to answer,” Smith told me.</p><p>Even by the standards of the previous cycle’s incredibly early <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/24/nx-s1-4977365/campaigns-are-starting-earlier-than-ever-due-in-part-to-early-voting\">campaigning</a>, all of this might seem rather premature to discuss. But as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/25/lets-make-sure-this-crisis-doesnt-go-waste/\">Emanuel</a> himself is famous for saying, a good crisis should never go to waste. Democratic presidential hopefuls are well aware that the party’s leadership vacuum is an opportunity—and they’re determined to not misuse it.</p><p><b>Related:</b></p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/democrats-hobbies/683163/?utm_source=feed\">Democrats need more hobbies.</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/democrats-man-problem/682029/?utm_source=feed\">Democrats have a man problem.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are three new stories from <i>The Atlantic</i>:</p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/chatgpt-ai-self-mutilation-satanism/683649/?utm_source=feed\">ChatGPT gave instructions for murder, self-mutilation, and devil worship.</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/trump-gaza-mistakes/683651/?utm_source=feed\">The worst-kept secret of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/psychological-secret-longevity/683624/?utm_source=feed\">The psychological secret to longevity</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Today’s News</strong></p><ol>\n\t<li>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/world/europe/france-palestine-statehood-macron-gaza.html\">France will recognize Palestine as a state</a>, which would make France the first G7 country to do so.</li>\n\t<li>House Democrats repeatedly attempted to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-force-republicans-vote-epstein-files-trump-rcna220606\">force votes on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein</a> yesterday.

But that’s because family separation has morphed into something less visible and possibly harder to track. In President Donald Trump’s second term, his administration has focused on dismantling a system specifically constructed to protect minors from the harsher aspects of immigration enforcement.</p><p>The system was built in response to reports of children dying in the custody of ICE. It diverts minors away from immigration enforcement, and toward a system focused on their safety and run through the Department of Health and Human Services. Congress provided funding, among other things, for lawyers to help minors move through asylum courts.</p><p>But anti-immigration Trump officials for years have complained about this separate track, and now they are innovating many bureaucratic and legalistic ways to break down those protections. Officials have kept minors in detention for longer periods, floated the idea of charging people who are applying for asylum, and they have made it harder for family members to claim minors.</p><p>In this episode, we visit two vulnerable minors who were just 5 and 2 years old when they crossed the border after escaping gang violence in Central America.</p><p><strong><em>The following is a transcript of the episode:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Hanna Rosin:</strong> Usually when a kid encounters a Lego set, they know what to do. Put the driver in the race car, the flamingo in the pond, the astronaut in the spaceship. But the Lego set this kid is playing with, it’s not so obvious what it is, or who goes where.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Boy:</strong> Pelón. Ahora es muy pelón.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> It features a lot of random characters—chef, painter, a robot, a knight.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Boy:</strong> Es el caballero. Caballero que defiende mi castillo.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>The kid picks up the knight, turns him over, pops off the helmet.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Kevin Townsend:</strong> Muy pelón.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boy:</strong> Muy pelón.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> <em>Muy pelón.</em> “Very bald.” He shows the pirate to our producer, Kevin.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Townsend:</strong> Pirata también muy pelón.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boy:</strong> Pirata muy pelón.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>Also bald. He sticks the pirate behind one of the desks—that’s where the lawyers would sit. He tries the knight at the witness stand and the robot on one seat that’s higher than all the rest—that is where the judge would sit.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Asiyah Sarwari:</strong> It’s really cute, but this is exactly what an immigration court will look like. So this stenographer would be there, and that’s where they have to go and talk. And so that’s where the judge comes from.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> This is Asiyah Sarwari, managing attorney at the Atlanta office of the International Rescue Committee, or IRC. She and her staff built this Lego court as a makeshift solution to an impossible problem: How do you explain to a 6-year-old what immigration court is?</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari: </strong>I mean, immigration court is frightening for everybody across the board, adults and kids, but this is a way for the kids to understand that this is a time for them to be able to tell their story and also to just give them some comfort.</p>\n\n<p>It really calms the kids down because when they go to court, then they’re like, <em>Oh, okay, this is where the judge sits. This is where I sit</em>, sort of thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boy:</strong> Pirata muy pelón. Yo soy rey. Son—</p>\n\n<p><strong>[<em>Sounds of Lego pieces falling on ground</em>]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Boy:</strong> Ay!</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> I’m Hanna Rosin. This is <em>Radio Atlantic</em>. Today, Trump’s immigration policy meets a 6-year-old boy.</p><p>Many of you listening might remember the phrase <em>family separation</em>, from Trump’s first term. Images of babies being torn from their mothers’ arms. Hysterical parents. Children in what looked like cages.</p><p><strong>[<em>Sounds of children crying</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>We haven’t seen a spectacle like that yet, mainly because there aren’t as many families crossing at the border. But that doesn’t mean things are any better for unaccompanied minors. This time around, the Trump administration is going after special protections for these kids, protections that have been carved out over the last decade.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Miroff:</strong> The United States government, you know, by and large, takes care of children and affords them a special treatment regardless of how they enter the country, even if they enter illegally.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> That’s Nick Miroff, an <em>Atlantic</em> staff writer who covers immigration.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> There was no need for them to try to evade capture by the U.S. Border Patrol. As minors, they could simply cross over and seek out the first Border Patrol agent they could find, turn themselves in, and knowingly be treated differently than other illegal border crossers.</p>\n\n<p>Because there have been some very horrible cases of deaths of children in U.S. Border Patrol custody, Border Patrol agents—who are effectively border cops—know that they have to be careful and handle these children with sensitivity, and they generally do.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> The way the system is currently set up: Children who cross the border without a parent find their way to a Border Patrol agent, who then quickly turns them over to another agency, called the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR. ORR tries to place them quickly with a sponsor, who’s typically a relative.</p><p>ORR is part of Health and Human Services, the idea being to keep minors out of the ICE system. Or that was the idea, before the Trump administration.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> They have, for the longest time, wanted to kind of break down that firewall between ICE—Immigration and Customs Enforcement—which is looking to arrest and deport immigrants who are here illegally, and Health and Human Services, whose mandate is to take good care of these kids, make sure nothing happens to them, get them to sponsors safely.</p>\n\n<p>You know, it’s a pivot toward an all-out, kind of enforcement-only-oriented model whose goal is to, you know, carry out the president’s mass-deportation campaign and, really, to break up the model that has been in place for much of the past 10 years.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> What specifically are they doing to break up the model?</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> They have stripped the funding for the legal-aid organizations that represent children and minors in federal custody and have worked with them. You know, they’ve just really deprived the system of resources.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>One of those was the nonprofit that funds Asiyah’s office. Earlier this year, as part of an executive order titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion,” funding was cut and these legal-service providers received a stop-work order, which would have affected about 26,000 kids.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> Conservatives have been very adamant that federal tax dollars should not go to defend and advocate for illegal immigrants and to help them get funding to stay in the United States.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong>  Legal-aid groups went to court, citing a law passed by Congress in 2008 creating certain protections for unaccompanied minors. A federal judge in California ordered the funding temporarily restored until a final judgment expected in September.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> If it happens again or if the litigation doesn’t work the way we want it to, it’s going to be very difficult to help these kids.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> What percent of your funding is this government funding?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> 99.9 percent. Yeah. It’s a lot. We do have some private backing, but the needs are so great that it’s just not feasible to move forward without programmatic funding.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff: </strong> There aren’t the resources to hire lawyers for every single person that comes across and makes a claim. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors, just in the Biden administration.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> The Trump administration says it wants to save money. Another reason to cut the funding might be that it’s effective. It increases the chance that the kids get legal status.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> If a person has a lawyer, they’re five times more likely to win their immigration case. So these kids qualify for legal status. They just need someone to guide them on the path.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> And just to clarify, five times as likely does not add up to likely.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> How hard is it to get asylum? Like, what percent of people who apply for asylum get asylum?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> Well, for immigration court in Atlanta, it’s less than 2 percent approved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh. It’s really hard.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> And so nationwide, if a person does not have an immigration attorney, they’re five times more likely to lose.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> Asylum is a many-step process. It can take years and years. And all of it is predicated on proving convincingly that you’ve been persecuted in your own country.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> We do have kids who have physical scars of what happened to them, why they had to flee their home country. You know, we have kids who were beaten by military in their home country because of who they’re affiliated with or who their parents or extended families are affiliated with.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, just for example, we had a 14-year-old who had a six-week-old child, and that’s because she was fleeing extreme danger in her home country, and then she was assaulted on the way over.</p>\n\n<p>So that’s the type of cruelty that our clients are facing. We really do see some graphic signs of violence and abuse.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> Absent the obvious signs, the lawyers have to find a way to get kids to describe what they’ve been through.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> So we just, you know, try to get some information from the kids. And we had a little 4-year-old who, every time, we asked her just some basic questions, but she would get scared and turn off the lights and hide under the table.</p>\n\n<p>And so then she had a little fake phone, and so she would hand the phone to the little girl and ask the questions and go back and forth. But a lot of the kids are so—they just don’t wanna discuss what’s happened in the past, whether they’re very young or very—you know, older. So we spend a lot of time to not re-traumatize them, hopefully.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> The majority of the kids who go through the system are preteens or teens. The boy we met in the office that day crossed the border with his younger sister. They were 5 and 2 when Asiyah first met them.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> What was the most difficult, at least for us, was trying to talk to them about what happened to them. The little girl couldn’t share any information, of course, because she was only 2 years old. But the older child, the 5-year-old, he was able to express fear but not exactly what happened.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> Here is what she learned: The family was targeted by gangs and experienced severe violence in their home country. They made it to the U.S.-Mexico border, but the situation there became dangerous for the kids. So the mother sent them ahead with a group crossing to the U.S. She had to wait for her own papers.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> They had to cross in a makeshift raft, and they fell into the river, and they were fished out.</p>\n\n<p>And so the children were—I keep using the word <em>traumatized</em>—were deeply traumatized. But you could tell from the Office of Refugee Resettlement documents—because usually the kids are pretty calm when it’s time for them to take their picture—because there’s a little passport photo that’s attached.</p>\n\n<p>And the kids were just <em>crying</em>. You could tell in the photo that they were sobbing in the photo.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> To help kids understand the process and feel safe enough to tell their story, Asiyah and her staff try to make their Atlanta offices as child friendly as they can. During our visit, the siblings sat in a room full of toys and stuffed animals, including a cow named Vaca Lola, and they tried very hard to sit still while they received what’s called a “Know Your Rights” presentation.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Legal assistant:</strong> Te voy a hacer unas preguntas. Yo soy una de las asistentes legales aquí que está trabajando en tu caso.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>An IRC legal assistant talks with them as they squirm on two beanbag chairs. As unaccompanied minors, the brother and sister need to know the basics about their rights and about the legal process. But the result is like a surreal kindergarten law school, where little kids are learning about things like attorney-client confidentiality.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Legal assistant: </strong>Tenemos una especial relación contigo que se llama <em>confidencialidad</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Girl:</strong> (<em>Indecipherable.</em>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal assistant: </strong>Uh-huh. ¿Lo puedes decir?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Sí.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal assistant: </strong>Con-fi-den-cia-li-dad. ¿Lo puedes decir?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boy: </strong>Sí. Confidencialidad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal assistant: </strong>Muy bien! Sí, confidencialidad. Lo que significa es que nosotros siempre tenemos que obtener tu permiso para compartir tu información.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> Being there in the room really underlines how absurd it is to think of kids like this navigating this situation without an attorney. The staffer asks the kids if they remember what a lawyer does. The little girl answers, <em>I want Vaca Lola</em>.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Legal assistant:</strong> ¿Te recuerdas lo que hace un abogado?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Sí.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal assistant:</strong> ¿Sí? ¿Qué hace?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Una Vaca Lola.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal assistant:</strong> ¿Ellos qué?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Girl:</strong> La Vaca Lola.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal assistant:</strong> ¿La Vaca Lola? Ellos tienen a veces una Vaca Lola.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> After the break: How the system isn’t just getting defunded—it’s being turned against the people it’s supposed to help.</p><p><strong>[<em>Break</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> The U.S. immigration system as it currently stands has two goals. One: to manage immigration itself—who gets to enter the country, when, where, and for how long. The other is to ensure the welfare of children that cross the border: Make sure they’re not subject to trafficking, bring them to safety, return them to relatives once those relatives have been vetted as so-called sponsors.</p><p>As Nick Miroff describes, those two goals are sometimes in tension.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> Up until now, there has existed basically, you know, a firewall between the sponsorship process and immigration enforcement by ICE, the idea being that if you have a kid in custody and you’re looking for a sponsor in order to get them out of government custody, then you shouldn’t have that sponsor fear arrest and deportation by coming forward and saying,<em> I will take custody of this child</em>.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> The idea was to make it as easy as possible for a sponsor to come forward, so the child would be safe. But that idea seems to be fading.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> Stephen Miller and the aides around him who are leading this broader immigration crackdown have had in their sights, for a long time, this system of unaccompanied minors who are crossing the border, are going through the sponsorship process, and in many cases are being reunited with their relatives who are already here. They view this system as basically a broader kind of trafficking scheme, and they want to attack it at its weak point, so to speak.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> That weak point is reunification: the moment where the government has your child, and you have to show proof in order to get them back. Under the Trump administration, the requirements have changed. Before, a sponsor might have taken a DNA test to prove they were related to the child. Now, though, they’re required to take a DNA test. And they also need to prove that they’re living and working in the U.S. legally, which means they have to show an American ID or a foreign passport with proof of entry. It means proof of income, like a letter from an employer.</p><p>The way the Trump administration explains these changes, they are protecting children from being picked up by people who don’t have their best interests at heart. But there are signs that in practice, these changes are keeping kids from landing in a safe place.</p><p>Our colleague Stephanie McCrummen <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/immigrants-children-deportation-ice-orr/683514/?utm_source=feed\">reported</a> that one family had submitted baby photos, baptism records, text messages—all to try to get their kid back, and all not enough. As she reported, the family had been rejected for three months and counting.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> And obviously, the concern is that if sponsors are too scared to come forward and take custody of the child, then the child will remain, you know, in the custody of the government for far longer than they should.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> Just that already appears to be happening. It varies from case to case, but the Office of Refugee Resettlement has typically housed an unaccompanied minor for about a month before they’re released to a sponsor. After Trump took office, the <a href=\"https://acf.gov/orr/about/ucs/facts-and-data\">average stay</a> for children released each month started rising: 49 days, 112 days, 217 days—all in facilities never intended to house children for so long.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> As we know, in a lot of these group-home settings, it can be very stressful. It’s not a good environment for children. There’s tons of, you know, pediatric literature about the impact on the psychology of children to be, you know, kept essentially in a kind of, you know, government custody in which they’re, you know, living under very strict rules, and they’re separated from their loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>And so, you know, no one, until now, has really wanted to prolong this process. But I think with this administration, we’re seeing a willingness to do that and to really try to deter families from potentially using this route in order to do the kind of phased migration that they’re so opposed to.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> For Trump officials who want to slow the pipeline of unaccompanied minors, it’s a win-win: Either families get their kids, and the government gets data they could use to pursue immigration enforcement, or they don’t get their kids, and the pain of the situation creates deterrence on its own.</p><p>It’s a kind of Family Separation 2.0, one that seems more carefully constructed than the first one. Americans aren’t regularly seeing children in what look like cages, or videos of agents taking babies from their mothers. Instead, it uses the system that already exists, and it generally does so away from cameras and microphones.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> You know, preventing them from reuniting is part of an enforcement mindset that is similar to zero-tolerance family separation, in that there’s a willingness here to, you know, potentially inflict trauma on children to achieve an immigration-enforcement purpose or some kind of deterrence.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not the same thing as physically pulling a child away from its parent at the border. But the willingness to leave a child in a group home in the government’s custody for weeks and weeks and weeks, and scare their parents into not coming to get them, is also a serious thing.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>The White House says they are doing this in the name of child welfare. And children getting exploited <em>is</em> in fact a vulnerability of the system.</p><p>In 2023, a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html\">investigation</a> showed that amid a huge influx of unaccompanied minors, many ended up working unsafe jobs in places like factories and slaughterhouses. They also showed that in 2021 and 2022, the Office of Refugee Resettlement couldn’t reach more than 85,000 children.</p><p>Now, that was during a period when the system was overwhelmed by a huge influx of unaccompanied minors. But losing contact like that simply meant they couldn’t easily reach the kids by phone, which could happen for any number of reasons. And ultimately, it’s maybe not so surprising that a family that got their child back has less reason to pick up when the federal government calls.</p><p>During his campaign, though, Trump spun these statistics into a much more sinister, and much more certain, story.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> 88,000 children are missing. You know that? Eighty-eight thousand. Think of that—88,000 children are missing under this administration, and they have no idea.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>In a matter of weeks, Trump’s number grew.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong> The Biden-Harris administration has lost track of an estimated 150,000 children, many of whom have undoubtedly been raped, trafficked, killed, or horribly abused. Think of it: 150,000 children are missing.</p>\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Three hundred and twenty-five thousand children are missing. Many are dead. Many are involved in sex operations. Many are working as slaves in different parts of probably this country and probably many others.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>Now in his current immigration crackdown, the administration has leaned into this story as a rationale for how it’s treating undocumented minors.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari: </strong>And what’s frustrating with that is that I think on both sides, everybody believes that there should be anti-trafficking initiatives. But our program is an anti-trafficking initiative. If these kids have a way forward, if they have a legal status, they’re less likely to be put in dangerous situations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Miroff:</strong> We have seen Tom Homan, the White House border czar, in particular, talking about “finding” the children. He has told me in interviews that this is as much a priority for him as carrying out the president’s mass-deportation campaign, and that he believes that hundreds of thousands of minors have been trafficked into the United States and may be in danger, and that he wants to mobilize the resources of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security to do, essentially, wellness checks on this group to make sure that they’re not in some kind of danger.</p>\n\n<p>However, I think that, you know, the underlying message of those checks by the authorities is very clear in that, you know, it’s part of this broader effort that they have going to gather information on families living in the United States illegally, who have come across illegally, who have participated in some of these arrangements, so that they can take enforcement action against them.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> The wellness checks are done by ICE but carried out with help from a hodgepodge of law enforcement, including the FBI and even the DEA. Asiyah told us that some clients her team works with have had agents show up at their door.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sarwari: </strong>What’s happening now is: There are these wellness checks where people from various law-enforcement agencies show up at the sponsors’ homes, bang on the doors. They’re masked. They don’t show any identification. And also, the wellness people who are conducting the wellness checks are not contacting us, their attorneys, so we can provide them the information that they need.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> And then, so what is the purpose then, do you think?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> To frighten them, I guess. Because we have reached out. We’ve had other clients who have had wellness checks, and we’ve driven out to go speak to whoever is there, but then they’re gone by the time we get there, and then we leave our information. Nobody will contact us.</p>\n\n<p>There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to them, and it’s not making anybody safer. What if it’s just some strange person who is not affiliated with law-enforcement agencies? None of them show any badges. None of them show any official paperwork. They’re masked. How are we supposed to know that one person is a law-enforcement agent versus a bad actor?</p>\n\n<p>We’re not hiding our clients. So it just doesn’t seem to result in what they want. It’s not really a wellness check.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin:</strong> About the wellness checks, which the White House officially calls a “national child welfare initiative,” an ICE spokesperson said in <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/dhs-initiative-uncovers-widespread-abuse-exploitation-unaccompanied-kids-placed\">a statement</a>, “Our agents are doing what they should’ve been doing all along: protecting children.”</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> I’m trying to think of this from an oppositional point of view. Like, if I’m listening to this and thinking, like, <em>Why should the U.S. government provide funding for lawyers for people who cross unlawfully?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> Well, I would say this is the overall focus, is: The kids need help, and we’re able to provide this help. We’re trying to protect children. But then I also say seeking asylum is a basic human right. These kids and their sponsors, their parents or whoever is guiding them, they’re trying to do things the right way. Most of them qualify for legal status. They just need someone to guide them on the path.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> And when you say doing “things the right way,” what do you mean?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> Well, you know, I use this phrasing because I’ve heard this, but the “right way” is that they have presented themselves to the government. They’re not hiding. They are trying to find a legal status.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosin:</strong> I think about this, often just kind of—<em>What is the nature of a country that opens itself up for asylum, versus the nature of a country that doesn’t?</em> Like, what decision are you making when you decide, <em>Oh, yes, we are a country that’s going to, you know, support a process, a legal process through which you can apply for asylum</em>? Like, what does that say about you as a country, versus if you—just, many countries don’t?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarwari:</strong> Well, and I also think that if you look at the other countries, they don’t have the opportunity. It’s not safe there either for them to seek asylum. So they really are coming to the first country that they’re able to have some semblance of safety.</p>\n</blockquote><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>In this family’s case, that’s the country they came to, one where a system of protections was in place, where they had an attorney to guide them, a known asylum process, even if not an easy one.</p><p>But now, the game has changed.</p><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Rosin: </strong>This episode of <em>Radio Atlantic</em> was produced by Kevin Townsend.

A large swath of the university community, including trustees who yearned for reform of their <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-antisemitism-israel-palestine-trump/682054/?utm_source=feed\">broken institution</a>, may even be quietly grateful: When past presidents attempted to take even minor steps to address the problem of campus anti-Semitism, they faced <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/05/09/university-senate-calls-for-pause-on-student-protesters-disciplinary-proceedings-over-concerns-on-proper-adjudication/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">resistance</a> from <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/09/25/university-senators-clash-with-task-force-on-antisemitism-co-chairs-over-second-report-at-plenary/\">faculty</a> and obstreperous <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/columbia-university-deans-resign-text-messages-antisemitism.html\">administrators</a>. Ongoing federal monitoring of Columbia’s civil-rights compliance, arguably the most significant component of the deal, will almost certainly compel the university to act more decisively in response to claims of anti-Jewish bias.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-antisemitism-israel-palestine-trump/682054/?utm_source=feed\">Franklin Foer: Columbia University’s anti-Semitism problem</a>]</i></p><p>Columbia’s decision to settle is understandable, but it’s also evidence of how badly the Trump era has numbed the conscience of the American elite. To protect its funding, Columbia sacrificed its freedom.</p><p>The settlement is contingent on Columbia following through on a series of promises that it made in March, when the Trump administration revoked $400 million in grants. The university agreed to install a vice provost to review academic programs focused on the Middle East to ensure they are “balanced.” It also pledged to hire new faculty for the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies.</p><p>As it happens, I agree: Many of Columbia’s programs espouse an unabashedly partisan view of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and more faculty at the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies would be a welcome development. The fields that will receive scrutiny have professors with documented records of bigotry. Columbia has long nurtured a coterie of activist academics who regard Israel’s very existence as a moral offense. Some have been accused of belittling students who challenged their views—and their example helped shape the culture of the institution. In time, students mimicked their teachers, ostracizing classmates who identified as Zionists or who simply happened to be born in Israel. After October 7, 2023, life on campus became <a href=\"https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Announcements/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf\">unbearable</a> for a meaningful number of Jewish students.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/?utm_source=feed\">Rose Horowitch: Anti-Semitism gets the DEI treatment</a>]</i></p><p>But in the government’s ideological intervention into campus culture, a precedent has been set: What Secretary of Education Linda McMahon <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/secretary-mcmahon-statement-columbia-university-deal\">calls</a> “a roadmap for elite universities” is a threat to the free exchange of ideas on campuses across the country, and abuse of that map is painfully easy to contemplate.</p><p>In part, many people at Columbia have shrugged at the settlement’s troubling provisions regulating the ideological composition of academic departments because the university already announced those steps in the spring. But it’s chilling to see them enshrined in a court document—signed by the university’s acting president, Claire Shipman, along with Attorney General Pam Bondi and two other Cabinet secretaries.</p><p>The university’s deal with the Trump administration “was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us,” Shipman said in a statement. The settlement contains a line meant to allay critics who worry about the loss of academic freedom: “No provision of this Agreement, individually or taken together, shall be construed as giving the United States authority to dictate faculty hiring, university admissions decisions, or the content of academic speech.” If the government doesn’t like whom Columbia hires, it can raise its concerns with a mutually agreed-upon “monitor” named Bart Schwartz, a former prosecutor who worked under Rudy Giuliani during his tenure as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, who will ostensibly render a neutral verdict. Schwartz’s ruling, however, won’t be binding. And if the government remains dissatisfied with Columbia’s conduct, it reserves the right to open a new investigation.</p><p>But Shipman’s protestations of independence ring hollow. The university has already agreed, under duress, to alter the ideological contours of its faculty. And even if I happen to support those particular changes, I can’t ignore the principle they establish. The tactics now being used to achieve outcomes I favor can just as easily be turned toward results I find abhorrent. That’s the nature of the American culture war. One side unearths a novel tactic; the other side applies it as retribution.</p><p>The Trump administration is likely to take the Columbia template and press it more aggressively upon other schools. It will transpose this victory into other contexts, using it to pursue broader purges of its perceived enemies. There’s no need to speculate about hidden motives: Both Donald Trump and Vice President <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2024/07/16/trump-taps-jd-vance-sharp-critic-higher-ed-vp\">J. D. Vance</a> have been explicit about their desire to diminish the power and prestige of the American university, to strip it of its ability to inculcate ideas they find abhorrent. They are trying to tame a profession they regard as a cultural adversary. “This is a monumental victory for conservatives who wanted to do things on these elite campuses for a long time because we had such far-left-leaning professors,” McMahon <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lupiv74kmm2n\">told Fox Business</a>.</p><p>Universities are desperately in need of reform. The paucity of intellectual pluralism in the academy undermines the integrity of the pursuit of knowledge. Failure of university trustees and presidents to make these changes on their own terms has invited government intervention. But the government has a new toehold in faculty rooms, not just at Columbia but at every private university in the country.</p>",

In his 1867 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1867/01/capillary-freaks/306062/?utm_source=feed\">treatise on hair</a> in <i>The Atlantic</i>, the poet extolled the revival of facial hair after its many ups and downs throughout history, from 15th-century France until America’s beard-loving Reconstruction. His nearly <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1867/01/capillary-freaks/306062/?utm_source=feed\">7,000-word meditation</a>, entitled “Capillary Freaks,” is long and messy, much like the author’s own <a href=\"https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/bd59d190-c5a6-012f-80d5-58d385a7bc34#/?uuid=b16926af-3eb6-6b2f-e040-e00a1806531a\">mustache</a> was. “The romance of hair is too prolific a subject to be lightly handled,” he rationalized, perhaps to his editor more than anyone. “It was very slow work, to be sure, getting people to separate the idea of folly, or of criminality, from the fact of wearing hair upon the lip.” But, finally, the battle was won. “Nowadays no man is martyred for his heresy on the subject of the razor.”</p><p>After a long absence from sophisticated culture, facial hair became more widely accepted in the mid-19th century. Encouraged by a letter from an 11-year-old girl, Abraham Lincoln was <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/04/abraham-lincoln-beard-portrait/682392/?utm_source=feed\">the first U.S. president to have a beard</a>. Ulysses S. Grant followed in his footsteps. Seven out of the eight presidents after him would all have envious facial hair, ranging in wildness. There was Benjamin Harrison’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/photos/benjamin-harrison-portrait-1\">neat trim</a>, Theodore Roosevelt’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/photos/theodore-roosevelt\">asymmetrical handlebar</a>, and Chester A. Arthur’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/photos/chester-a-arthur\">electrified chops</a>. This lineage ended once William Howard Taft and his proportionately enormous mustache left the White House in 1913. No president since has donned man’s natural accessory, though some count the stubble Harry Truman grew on vacation in 1948—I don’t.</p><p>The post-Taft decades were a facial-hair great depression. Generations of young men cycled through the military, which forbids beards. There were concerns about hygiene, and professional settings encouraged a clean-shaven look—which was all the more attainable after safety razors boomed in popularity. The beard came to mean many things in America, none particularly good. “Long black chin whiskers” might signal poverty, as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1939/10/rich-men/654254/?utm_source=feed\">they did</a> for Jesse Stuart in 1939. Or “indifference to public opinion,” as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/09/the-glory-that-is-cambridge/656034/?utm_source=feed\">the beard did</a> for Frances H. Eliot in 1945. Or depression, for Leslie Norris in 1977: “He feels dirty with all that beard on him,” an understanding wife <a href=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/archives/1977/04/239-4/132568247.pdf\">says</a> about her husband in Norris’s short story “Shaving.”</p><p>By the ’60s, facial hair was considered countercultural, adopted by hippies and revolutionaries. Its appeal widened in the ’80s, thanks to the rise of rugged mustaches. Lawyers and doctors didn’t grow them, but <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/player/121/career\">athletes</a> did, as did icons in the professions that end with <i>star</i> (rock, porn, movie).</p><p>Then came the flannel-wearing, vinyl-loving <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/meet-the-real-life-hipster-for-obama-an-unemployed-spaniard/263519/?utm_source=feed\">hipsters</a>, who killed the cool factor of facial hair. In the 2010s, mustaches were no longer meant to be casually perched upon one’s lip—they were screen-printed on quirky shirts, chained onto <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/10/stache-me-maybe-justin-bieber-and-the-fake-mustache-industrial-complex/263760/?utm_source=feed\">novelty sunglasses</a>, and <a href=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/n2q3qktz7xwr/30ft04rMIDlcYyBiETDSx5/e586fcdeb7e97d13f083f3ce06548749/how-to-5-hipster-beard-styles-style-5-sp.jpg\">beard-waxed</a> into curls by guys who liked craft beer and indie music. The power of such cringe-ification is nowhere more apparent than in a 2010 <i>Atlantic</i> article by the writer Chris Good, who <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/09/state-of-the-stache-an-interview-with-mustache-chairman-aaron-perlut/63486/?utm_source=feed\">interviewed</a> Aaron Perlut, the “chairman of the American Mustache Institute” (his real title at the time).</p><p>“There is a sexual dynamic between people who have entered the Mustached American lifestyle and the pleasure that they are able to provide to their partners, that only the Mustached American is capable of,” Perlut said. “Those that are not capable of living a Mustached American lifestyle, or are unwilling for some reason, can never quite understand that dynamic, but again it goes beyond our sexual proclivities and more to a full, broad lifestyle.” Okay.</p><p>But if facial hair could no longer be cool, it could be something else: common. These days, calculating politicians disappear for weeks to grow beards, in the hope of seeming <i>less</i> calculating. Vice President J. D. Vance and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have both adopted beards. So has Senator Chris Murphy—perhaps an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/chris-murphy-populism/683245/?utm_source=feed\">effort to shed his pointy-headed image</a>, as my colleague Gilad Edelman suspected. (Murphy denied that he was going “for a more working-dude aesthetic,” as Edelman put it.) Those politicians may not be wrong to think their beards might help their image. My colleague Olga Khazan <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/beards-why/422157/?utm_source=feed\">supported</a> then-Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision to grow a beard in 2015, “since Republicans have struggled to entice women voters.” The <i>Atlantic</i> writer Yair Rosenberg noticed in 2022 that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/08/joe-biden-dark-brandon-memes/676790/?utm_source=feed\">several memes</a> made by Joe Biden’s supporters showed him as “Dark Brandon,” sometimes with a beard, a semi-ironic symbol of the vitality that the president so visibly lacked.</p><p>Today, Peak Facial Hair has arguably returned. The New York Yankees, a franchise that long forbade its players from growing a beard, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/02/yankees-facial-hair-beards/681818/?utm_source=feed\">reversed course</a> earlier this year. The post-pandemic beard is ubiquitous, and the beardless ’stache, often paired with a mullet, has become a trendy expression of young masculinity.</p><p>After roughly a year of being sufficiently annoyed about shaving so often, I too grew a beard. Then I shaved my chin to look like Chester Arthur for a weekend. Then I shaved the chops, leaving the mustache. Finally, I went clean for a bit, before restarting the cycle last year: beard, mustache, then clean-shaven in time for my job interviews at <i>The Atlantic</i>.</p><p>At the moment, I’m back in the mustache stage, sporting a style some <a href=\"https://cremocompany.com/blogs/blog/mustache-styles\">call</a> “the Walrus.” I’m happy with the look, but I’m sure my beard will make its eventual return. How can I resist? Peak Facial Hair never lasts forever.</p>",

A 2011 <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/diplomacy-and-politics/6-in-10-palestinians-reject-2-state-solution-survey-finds\">poll</a> found that two-thirds of Palestinians believed that their real goal should not be a two-state solution, but rather using that arrangement as a prelude to establishing “one Palestinian state.” A 2016 <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/03/09/among-israeli-arabs-and-jews-limited-optimism-about-a-two-state-solution/\">survey</a> found that nearly half of Israeli Jews agreed that “Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel.” A <a href=\"https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/461\">poll</a> in 2000, conducted during negotiations toward a two-state solution, found that only 47 percent of Israelis and 10 percent of Palestinians supported a school curriculum that would educate students to “give up aspirations for parts of the ‘homeland’ which are in the other state.”</p><p>These stark statistics illustrate why the conflict has proved so intractable: Palestinians and Israelis subscribe to dueling national movements with deeply held and mutually exclusive historical and religious claims to the same land. After a century of violence and dispossession, it should not be surprising that many would happily wish the other side away, if such an option existed. The current American administration, though, is the first to reinforce those ambitions, rather than curtail them.</p><p>Aside from the efforts of beleaguered moderates, what restrains the region’s worst impulses is not principle, but practicality. Neither side can fully vanquish the other without unending bloodshed, and the international community has long refused to countenance an outcome in which one group simply routs the other. Instead, successive American presidents—with the notable exception of Donald Trump—have insisted that Israelis and Palestinians resolve their differences bilaterally at the negotiating table.</p><p>Efforts to broker territorial compromise have repeatedly failed, but they had the effect of constraining maximalist aspirations on the ground. Consider the admission of Matan Kahana, a conservative Israeli politician: “If there was a sort of button you could push that would make all the Arabs disappear, sending them on an express train to Switzerland where they would live fantastic lives, I would press that button,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/kann_news/status/1536558295824994306\">told</a> a student group in a right-wing settlement in 2022. “But what can you do? There is no such button. It therefore seems we were meant to coexist on this land in some way.” The comments leaked and Kahana was compelled to apologize, but the private recording revealed something interesting: Even a pro-settler lawmaker speaking to a sympathetic audience understood that the dream of ousting the other was unrealistic.</p><p>That began to change on October 7, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/what-hamas-wants-israel/675648/?utm_source=feed\">Hamas</a>, a Palestinian faction fanatically committed to ending Israel, massacred some 1,200 Israelis, and the Israeli far right saw an opportunity to attain its own thwarted ambitions. In 2005, Israel had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/18/world/middleeast/tearfully-but-forcefully-israel-removes-gaza-settlers.html\">forcibly removed</a> all of its settlers from Gaza and ceded the Strip to Palestinian control. Eighteen years later, as Israel’s army reentered the area, the radicals in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government sought to turn back the clock—and to expel any Palestinians in their way.</p><p>“The sole picture of victory in this war that will allow us to lift our heads,” the lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/limor_sonhrmelh/status/1734294096175391070\">declared</a> in late 2023, “is settlements across the entire Gaza Strip.” In November, Har-Melech and her allies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/T_Nachala/status/1732844953900896755\">spoke</a> at a conference titled “Returning to the Gaza Strip” in Ashdod, a city between Tel Aviv and Gaza. Weeks later, more than 100 activists <a href=\"https://www.davar1.co.il/472527/\">gathered</a> in central Israel under the banner, “Practical Preparation for Settlement in Gaza.” In January 2024, 15 of the 64 members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition at the time attended an even larger gathering in Jerusalem, where speakers openly <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-29/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-people-of-israel-will-settle-gaza-netanyahu-ministers-urge-palestinians-expulsion/0000018d-5495-d1b6-aded-5fdd570c0000\">advocated</a> the “voluntary migration” of Gazans—a euphemism for ethnic cleansing.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/12/israel-right-wing-settler-gaza-netanyahu/676943/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The right wing Israeli campaign to resettle Gaza</a>]</i></p><p>Polls show that a <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/majority-of-israelis-oppose-annexation-resettlement-of-gaza-poll\">clear</a> <a href=\"https://www.inss.org.il/publication/survey-april-2025/\">majority</a> of Israelis oppose the resettlement and annexation of Gaza. Even some Israelis who dream of one day ruling the entire land balk in practice at the notion of maintaining a perpetual military occupation against a Hamas insurgency. But Israel’s prime minister is beholden to the minority demanding exactly that. Netanyahu’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/netanyahu-coalition-falling-apart/683568/?utm_source=feed\">fragile coalition</a> received just <a href=\"https://votes25.bechirot.gov.il/\">48.4 percent</a> of the vote in Israel’s last election, and relies on explicitly anti-Arab <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/12/israel-election-bibi-netanyahu-ben-gvir/672572/?utm_source=feed\">far-right factions</a> to remain in power while Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. President Joe Biden understood this dynamic, and his administration undertook a public and private pressure campaign to prevent Netanyahu from acceding to his hard-right allies.</p><p>“We have been clear, consistent, and unequivocal that Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land,” the State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a January 2024 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/4385605-us-rebukes-irresponsible-comments-from-israeli-ministers/\">statement</a>, publicly rebuking two Netanyahu ministers for their “inflammatory and irresponsible” call to <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/ben-gvir-war-an-opportunity-to-encourage-migration-from-gaza/\">encourage</a> “migration” from Gaza to make way for Jewish settlement.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to the region and assured America’s Arab allies that it opposed forced displacement. “Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,” he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/blinken-presses-arab-states-discuss-future-gaza-2024-01-07/\">said</a> at a press conference in Doha, Qatar. “They cannot, they must not, be pressed to leave Gaza.” Blinken then <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/10/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine-updates/\">traveled</a> to Israel, where he apparently delivered the same message to Netanyahu. The next day, the Israeli leader posted a <a href=\"https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1745186120109846710\">video</a> in which he declared, “Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.” A member of Netanyahu’s party <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-let-me-be-clear-israel-has-no-intention-of-displacing-gazas-population/\">told</a> the press that the prime minister’s stance had shifted because of American pressure. For the moment, maximalism had been shoved back into the box.</p><p>Then Donald Trump won reelection, and everything changed. The same day Trump defeated Kamala Harris, Netanyahu fired <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/02/claudine-gay-israel-icj-context/677341/?utm_source=feed\">Yoav Gallant</a>, his defense minister, who had <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/01/29/israel-gaza-settlements-buffer-gallant-blinken-biden\">opposed</a> the resettlement of Gaza and publicly <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/05/israel-defense-netanyahu-gaza-gallant/678391/?utm_source=feed\">criticized</a> the prime minister for refusing to commit to returning the territory to Palestinian control. In one fell swoop, the chief external (Biden) and internal (Gallant) obstacles to conquering Gaza were removed. The only pressure exerted on Netanyahu now was from the hard right. And then Trump himself seemingly joined its cause.</p><p>On February 4, sitting next to a surprised Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump dramatically undid all of Biden’s efforts, promising to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/politics/netanyahu-trump-white-house-meeting\">take over Gaza</a>, relocate its residents, and turn the area into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” The president may have conceived of this vision out of some misdirected sense of compassion, believing it would provide better lives for Palestinians now stuck in what he correctly termed a “demolition site.” But whatever Trump’s intentions, his proposal was immediately taken as affirmation of the maximalist dream of many Israelis, and an explicit warrant for ethnic cleansing by the Israeli far right. Once that prospect turned from a pipe dream into a president’s plan, it quickly became an obstruction to concluding the conflict.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/05/israel-policy-smotrich-bengvir-palestine/682986/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The two extremists driving Israel’s policy</a>]</i></p><p>At a press conference in May, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-implementation-of-trumps-gaza-relocation-plan-is-condition-for-ending-war/\">declared</a> that implementing Trump’s vision was now a condition for ending the war. Last week, the director of the Mossad reportedly <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/israel-send-palestinians-gaza-indonesia-ethiopia\">visited</a> Washington to discuss the “voluntary” relocation of “hundreds of thousands of Palestinians” to third-party countries. All the while, Gaza’s hunger crisis has dramatically worsened, while hostages continue to languish in Hamas dungeons. Far from expediting the conflict’s end, Trump’s proposal has been marshaled to prolong it. And as long as the president does not explicitly reject the goal of removing the Gazan population, it will continue to bedevil his plans for the region.</p><p>That’s because the maximalists are now driving events. Hamas, a messianic cult that never cared for the civilians it hid within and beneath, will happily continue fighting its unwinnable war against Israel to the last Gazan. Netanyahu will do whatever keeps his coalition in power, kowtowing to the far right and extending the war in service of their aims rather than winding it down. But this is not the outcome that Trump or his administration professes to want. The president has not raised his Riviera idea in months, and has instead begun <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-official-gaza-ceasefire-more-likely-than-not-but-gaps-remain-over-ending-war/#:~:text=significant%20pressure\">pressuring Israel</a> to compromise. “MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!” Trump <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/make-the-deal-in-gaza-trump-demands-in-late-night-post/\">posted</a> on Truth Social June 29.</p><p>“The president’s message on this conflict in the Middle East, which has been going on for a long time and has become quite brutal—especially in Gaza—is clear,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/american-politics/article-861793?fbclid=IwY2xjawLtqlJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFpMVZTR1h4YjF6ZE1PV254AR6pCg7g5wBD0dfOCZDBWB50c2E4E0WZIl0dqvPVEZRtIREfW3eTsPOrg4Z7FQ_aem_HrY5vYTZUQIXOKdMgcOHwQ\">said</a> on Monday. “He wants the killing to end, to negotiate a cease-fire in this region, and he wants to see all of the hostages released from Gaza.” But the president’s message is not clear. It is contradictory, and that is the source of the problem.</p><p>This week, Trump dispatched his Middle East special envoy <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/steve-witkoff-putin-russia-ukraine-diplomat/682805/?utm_source=feed\">Steve Witkoff</a> overseas, amid hopes of clinching a deal. But if the administration wants more than another temporary cease-fire that will inevitably collapse, it needs to stop feeding the Israeli right’s dream of conquest—in Gaza, but also the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/israel-passes-symbolic-motion-to-annex-west-bank-settlements\">West</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/israel-settlers-violence-netanyahu-government/675755/?utm_source=feed\">Bank</a>. It must make clear that neither nation is going anywhere and once again confine the absolutist aspirations it unwisely unleashed.</p><p>Netanyahu may want to placate the far right, but with his coalition <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/07/netanyahu-coalition-falling-apart/683568/?utm_source=feed\">falling apart</a> and elections scheduled for 2026 in any event, he absolutely cannot afford to lose the American president before his next campaign. Whatever Trump dictates, as both Israel’s and Netanyahu’s primary patron, the prime minister will have to accept.</p><p>A president’s words have power. With his Gaz-a-Lago intervention, Trump made attaining a lasting cease-fire in Gaza—not to mention broader peace in the Middle East—much harder. But by the same token, he has the capacity to reverse that reality, if he is willing to disown his biggest blunder.</p>",
